# Project Proposal
## DATA606: Initial Proposal

1. What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
> I'm interested in understanding more about the Department of Health and Human Services- Office of Inspector General's historical work and work patterns, by utilizing text analytics on work plan items. These work plan items and reports are all public data.

2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
> Healthcare compliance officers, hospitals, and the public are interested in how HHS OIG protects them from issues. 

3. What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
- Descriptive statistics to understand the breakdown of past work that OIG has undertaken.
- Using text analytics, perform topic modeling to analyze common themes over the past three years.
- With models, analyze changes in topics and new focus areas that OIG is performing.

4. Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?
> 
5. What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?
> 
6. What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?
> 
7. What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
> 
8. How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
> 
9. What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
>

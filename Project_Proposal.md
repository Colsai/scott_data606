# DATA606: Protecting Modern US Healthcare
### Analysis and Modeling of Common Problem Areas through DHHS OIG Data

**1. What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?**  
I'm interested in understanding more about the Department of Health and Human Services- Office of Inspector General's historical work and work patterns, by utilizing text analytics on work plan items. These work plan items and reports are all public data.

During my time with OIG HHS, we coordinate updates and improvements for the existing data. However, those improvements largely fall outside of content analysis, and my interest here is providing an analysis of here.

**2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?**  
The Department of Health and Human Services- Office of Inspector General is the largest inspector general in the United States. OIG was established in 1976, to protect the American public from fraud, waste, and abuse, with a central focus on Medicare and Medicaid programs. Healthcare compliance officers, hospitals, and the public are interested in how HHS OIG protects them from issues. 

There are many avenues for fraud, waste, and abuse, and an extensive analysis of the projects over the past three years provides confidence to medical professionals and the public that HHS OIG is continuing to protect vulnerable populations of people (elderly, low-income, minority groups, all which may be disproportionately affected by fraud/waste/abuse). 

**3. What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?** 
- What are some themes and trends we can view from looking at the projects that OIG is undertaking?
- Do we (and how do we) see the influence of major health events, such as COVID, within the scope of OIG's work?
- 

**4. Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?**  
- HHS OIG displays all public projects, which can be found at https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/.
- The primary challenge is in finding a way to scrape the data. The initial scrape of the data for all projects 

**5. What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?**  
- Projects and Reports scraped from HHS OIG website, 2017-Current.
 
**6. What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?**  
- Titles of work project
- Status of Project (Completed, Cancelled, In-Progress)
- Agency focus areas (CMS/FDA/CDC/etc.)
- Summaries of work projects
- Summaries of reports
- Status of items

**7. What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?**  
- Text Analytics
- NLP

**8. How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?**  

**9. What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?**

Effective FY 2015, States will report actual transfers, expenditures, and unliquidated obligations (henceforth referred to as expenditures) made with each open grant year award during a fiscal year on form ACF-196R.  Each quarterly report will reflect expenditures cumulative through that quarter for the fiscal year, resulting in a fourth quarter report that reflects actual expenditures made with the grant year award funds for the fiscal year.  States will no longer report expenditures cumulative through the current reporting period.  We will determine the accuracy of States''' reporting of TANF spending information using the new form ACF-196R.",

        Under the Medicare Part A inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS), hospitals are paid a predetermined amount per discharge for inpatient hospital services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, as long as the beneficiary has at least one benefit day at the time of admission.  The prospective payment amount represents the total Medicare payment for the inpatient operating costs associated with a beneficiary's hospital stay.  Inpatient operating costs include routine services, ancillary services (e.g., radiology and laboratory services), special care unit costs, malpractice insurance costs, and preadmission services.  Accordingly, hospitals generally receive no additional payments for nonphysician outpatient services furnished shortly before and during inpatient stays.  Medicare makes a duplicate payment if it makes a separate Part B payment to providers for such nonphysician outpatient services.

Our recent work indicated that providers are still billing inappropriately and contractors continue to make inappropriate payments for these nonphysician outpatient services.  Additionally, Medicare payment system controls are not preventing or detecting overpayments for incorrectly billed services.  Our objective is to determine whether nationwide Medicare payments to hospital outpatient providers were correct for nonphysician outpatient services provided within 3 days prior to the date of admission, on the date of admission, or during IPPS stays (excluding date of discharge).</br></br>",

In calendar year 2019, Medicare Part B allowed approximately $1 billion for psychotherapy services, including individual and group therapy.  A prior OIG review found that Medicare allowed $185 million in inappropriate outpatient mental health services, including psychotherapy services that were not covered and were inadequately documented.  Pursuant to authority granted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and section 1135 of the Social Security Act, and retroactive to March 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human Services authorized CMS to temporarily implement waivers and modifications to Medicare program requirements and conditions of participation for telehealth.

In 2015, Federal Medicaid managed care payments were approximately $161.8 billion, which was more than 40 percent of the $349.8 billion in total Federal expenditures for Medicaid.  States continue to expand their use of managed care.  To deliver services to Medicaid managed care enrollees, States contract with managed care organizations (MCOs) and make monthly payments, called a capitation payment, to those plans to provide enrollees with Medicaid-covered services.  Appropriately set capitation rates help to ensure that adequate payments are made to provide services to beneficiaries.  We will examine how Medicaid funds received by MCOs are used to provide services to enrollees.",

Malnutrition can result from the treatment of another condition, inadequate treatment or neglect, or the general deterioration of a patient's health.  Medicare sets forth a number of Federal requirements, including the Social Security Act § 1862(a)(1)(A), related to billing for the treatment of severe malnutrition.   Hospitals are allowed to bill for the treatment of malnutrition on the basis of the severity of the condition - mild, moderate, or severe, and whether it affects patient care.  Severe malnutrition is classified as a major complication or comorbidity (MCC).  Adding an MCC to a Medicare claim can result in a higher Medicare payment because the claim is coded at a higher Diagnosis Related Group.  This review will assess the accuracy of Medicare payments for the treatment of severe malnutrition.  We will determine whether providers are complying with Medicare billing requirements when assigning diagnosis codes for the treatment of severe types of malnutrition on inpatient hospital claims.",

A prior OIG review identified Medicare overpayments to hospitals that did not comply with Medicare's post-acute-care transfer policy (42 CFR § 412.4(c)).  We found that hospitals transferred patients to certain post-acute-care settings but improperly claimed the higher reimbursement associated with discharges ""to home.""  Specifically, these hospitals used incorrect patient discharge status codes on their claims by indicating that their patients were discharged ""to home"" rather than transferred to a post-acute-care setting (e.g., home health services, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), non-Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) hospitals or hospital units).  OIG's review found that CMS common working file (CWF) edits related to transfers to home health care, SNFs, and non-IPPS hospitals were not working properly.  As a result, OIG recommended that CMS correct the CWF edits, ensure they are working properly, and recover the identified overpayments in accordance with its policies and procedures.  CMS agreed with the recommendations and stated that it will update the CWF edits.  This followup audit will determine whether CMS corrected the CWF edits and ensured they are working properly.",

In response, both the U.S. Surgeon General and CMS have stated that increasing access to naloxone, especially among members of the public who are at risk or who know someone at risk, is a top priority. Naloxone is a medication designed to rapidly reverse opioid overdose.  However, many stakeholders have expressed concerns that the high cost of naloxone may impede increased access.  Medicaid could play a significant role in addressing the issue of naloxone access because the program covers nearly 40 percent of nonelderly adults with opioid addiction.  This report will show (1) trend utilization of and expenditures for naloxone in Medicaid over a 5-year period; (2) determine how the cost-per-dose for naloxone under Medicaid compares to other available prices; and (3) determine the proportion of all naloxone distributed in the U.S. that was paid under Medicaid between 2014 and 2018.

        Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is a significant component of the treatment protocols for opioid use disorder and plays a large role in combating the opioid epidemic in the United States.  Congress has taken sustained action to support MAT services through broadened prescribing authorities, increased Federal funding, and enhanced insurance protections.  However, a treatment gap continues to exist where less than 1 percent of the people in the United States who need treatment for substance use disorder receive it.  OIG will examine access to MAT through health centers funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  Health centers are key entities to expand access to MAT because they provide both primary care and behavioral healthcare services and accept patients regardless of their ability to pay.  Additionally, in recent years, HRSA has awarded grant funding specifically to expand access to substance use disorder treatment at health center sites.  We will examine how many health centers provide MAT services, what types of services they provide (e.g., specific medications, behavioral health services such as counseling), how many of their providers are waivered to prescribe MAT drugs, and how many patients they are treating with MAT.  We will also examine the factors that may either facilitate or hinder the provision of MAT in health centers.",

However, FDA's oversight of the nation's drug supply chain has become increasingly complicated because many drugs used in the U.S. are manufactured overseas.  FDA estimates that nearly 40 percent of finished drugs and approximately 80 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients are manufactured in registered establishments in more than 150 countries.  To ensure that drugs are manufactured in compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations, FDA conducts inspections of foreign facilities that manufacture drugs for the U.S. market.  At the end of an inspection, observations are made and a determination of whether any condition or practice violates Federal requirements.  FDA may take additional actions to ensure that the violations are corrected.  In May 2017, FDA began implementing major programmatic changes to enhance its ability to protect public health.  FDA's major programmatic changes included a structural realignment of its Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) and an agreement between FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and ORA that aligns and coordinates FDA's field professionals who conduct inspections and its review staff who evaluate drug products.

These data briefs assist CMS in ensuring that bidding suppliers meet the statutory requirement located at section 1847(b)(10)(A) of the Act, known as the 50-percent rule.  Section 50414 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended section 1847(b)(10)(A) by requiring that, for bids to furnish DTS on or after January 1, 2019, CMS must use both mail order and non-mail order data when assessing compliance with the 50-percent rule.  Prior to that amendment, OIG reported only mail order data in its data briefs used for CMS's assessment of compliance with the 50-percent rule.  For this series, the first data brief will determine the Medicare market share of mail order DTS for the 3-month period of April through June 2019.  The second data brief will determine the Medicare market share of non-mail order DTS for the same 3-month period.  This will be the fifth series of OIG data briefs describing the Medicare market share of DTS that OIG has produced since 2010 and the second series that will include both mail order and non-mail order DTS data.",

When there is inadequate SA performance, CMS may impose a sanction or remedy, such as providing for training of survey teams, requiring the SA to submit a corrective action plan, or reducing the State's allotment of Federal financial participation.  We will describe CMS's efforts to work with SAs to improve performance by conducting interviews and reviewing supporting documentation about CMS's monitoring efforts.  We will also identify any challenges or barriers that may impede CMS's ability to help SAs improve performance.",

To ensure that hospice care does not exceed the cost of conventional medical care at the end of life, Medicare imposes two annual limits to payments made to hospice providers: the inpatient cap and the aggregate cap.  The inpatient cap limits the number of days of inpatient care for which Medicare will pay to 20 percent of a hospice's total Medicare patient care days, and a hospice must refund to Medicare any payment amounts in excess of the inpatient cap.  The aggregate cap limits the total aggregate payments that any individual hospice can receive in a cap year to an allowable amount based on an annual per-beneficiary cap amount and the number of beneficiaries served.  Any amount paid to a hospice for its claims in excess of the aggregate cap is considered an overpayment and must be repaid to Medicare.  Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) oversee the cap process and hospices must file their self-determined aggregate cap determination notice with their MAC no later than 5 months after the end of the cap year and remit any overpayment due at that time.",

Durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers must maintain documentation from the physician or treating practitioner indicating that the PMD being repaired continued to be medically necessary and that the repairs were reasonable and necessary.  DME suppliers must also maintain detailed records describing the need for and nature of all repairs, which includes a justification for the replaced parts and the labor time.  In addition, if the expense for repairs exceeds the estimated expense of purchasing or renting another PMD for the remaining period of medical need, no payment can be made for the amount of the excess.

Medicare also covers clinical laboratory services, including urine drug testing (UDT), under Part B.  Physicians use UDT to detect the presence or absence of drugs or to identify specific drugs in urine samples.  A patient in active treatment for an SUD or being monitored during different phases of recovery from an SUD may undergo medical management for a variety of medical conditions.  UDT results influence treatment and level-of-care decisions for individuals with SUDs.  The 2018 Medicare fee-for-service improper payment data showed that laboratory testing, including UDT, had an improper payment rate of almost 30 percent, and that the overpayment rate for definitive drug testing for 22 or more drug classes was 71.7 percent.

The goal of IHS is to ensure that comprehensive, culturally acceptable personal and public health services are available and accessible to all of the approximately 2.6 million members of the 573 federally recognized Tribes.  In 1975, Congress recognized the importance of Tribal decision making in Tribal affairs and the nation-to-nation relationship between the United States and Tribes through the passage of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) (P.L. No. 93-638).  Under ISDEAA, federally recognized Tribes administer their own healthcare programs and services that IHS would otherwise provide through P.L. No. 93-638 funding agreements with IHS.  In 2019, a pediatrician who worked at several IHS health facilities during a 21-year period was convicted of sexually abusing children served at these facilities.

Revised,National Institutes of Health,Grantee Institutions' Actions To Strengthen Policies in Response to Concerns Regarding Potential Foreign Influence on NIH-Funded Research,Office of Evaluation and Inspections,OEI-03-20-00210,2022,https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000448.asp,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires grantee institutions to report their researchers' financial interests and affiliations with foreign entities.  
        NIH and Congress have raised concerns that the failure by some NIH-funded researchers to disclose to grantee institutions substantial contributions of resources from other organizations, 
        including foreign governments, threatens to distort decisions about the appropriate use of NIH funds.  In response to these concerns, NIH has taken steps to improve the accurate reporting of all sources of research support, financial interests, and affiliations.  
        In July 2019, NIH released a notice to its extramural research community clarifying its policy regarding other support, including foreign affiliations.  
        Given NIH's efforts to increase awareness among its grantee institutions regarding financial interests and foreign influence, this evaluation will focus on grantee 
        institutions' policies and procedures related to (1) ensuring that researchers report all foreign affiliations (including foreign positions and scientific appointments, 
        financial interests in foreign entities, research support from foreign entities, and any other foreign affiliations) and (2) reviewing the foreign affiliations that researchers report.

The second part will describe the characteristics of the nursing homes that were hardest hit by the pandemic (i.e., homes with high numbers of beneficiaries who had COVID-19).  The third part will describe the strategies nursing homes used to mitigate the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19.  These challenges include procuring critical supplies, testing residents and staff, isolating high numbers of contagious residents, caring for those afflicted, and protecting residents and staff on a scale never before experienced in this country.",

In response to COVID-19, on April 15, 2020, the Children's Bureau—the operating division of the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) that administers the Title IV-B and Title IV-E programs at the Federal level—provided flexibility to State Title IV-E agencies related to (1) fingerprint-based criminal record checks requirements for prospective foster parents (allowing for name-based checks until fingerprint-based checks can safely be done), and (2) caseworker visit requirements (allowing videoconferencing visits to count toward the requirement that 50 percent of visits must occur in the child's home).  On April 27, 2020, the Children's Bureau reminded States of additional flexibilities afforded by the Statute, including the authority to modify foster family licensing standards as long as the standards are applied to all of these placements in accordance with the requirements of the Statute.  Additionally, States have the authority to set their own foster care maintenance payment rates including, at their own discretion, enhancing those rates for children who test positive for COVID-19.

As per the CDC, prompt detection, triage, and isolation of potentially infectious patients are essential to prevent unnecessary exposures among patients and health care personnel at dialysis facilities.  ESRD treatment facilities are organized into groups called Networks.  Network Organizations under CMS contracts develop relationships with dialysis professionals, providers, and patients, and create a collaborative environment to improve patient care.  The Network Organizations' contracts include statutory responsibilities and quality improvement activities that could be important in protecting ESRD beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition to Network Organizations, the ESRD National Coordinating Center (NCC) supports and coordinates activities for the ESRD program on a national level.  We will interview Network Organizations, NCC, and CMS officials to identify the actions Network Organizations are taking to aid dialysis clinics and patients in response to COVID-19 and keep CMS abreast of quality-of-care issues resulting from COVID-19.",

American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the relatively high rates of diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and asthma among these populations.  These vulnerabilities can be heightened by the strong familial structures in AI/AN communities, in which families commonly live in multigenerational homes.  Such socially cohesive communities provide a broad range of benefits to their members, but paradoxically these strong structures make it all the more difficult to maintain physical distancing during a pandemic., IHS has received funding for medical supplies and equipment through the COVID-19 relief bills allocated to IHS, Tribal, and UIHP facilities.

CMS risk-adjusts these payments by using beneficiaries' diagnoses to pay higher capitated payments to MA organizations (MAOs) for beneficiaries expected to have greater health care needs.  This payment policy may create financial incentives for MAOs to misrepresent beneficiaries' health status and make them appear to have additional illnesses and other conditions that would command higher payment.  A previous OIG evaluation identified $6.7 billion in estimated 2017 risk-adjusted payments resulting from diagnoses that MAOs reported only on chart reviews, and not on any records of services provided to beneficiaries in 2016.  Findings from this evaluation raise concerns about the completeness of payment data that MAOs submit to CMS, the validity of diagnoses on chart reviews, and the quality of care provided to beneficiaries.  A current OIG evaluation examines the extent to which diagnoses solely generated by health risk assessments (HRAs) were associated with higher risk scores and higher MA payments.  We will combine data from these evaluations to perform new analyses that will determine whether certain MAOs and parent organizations had higher or lower amounts of risk-adjusted payments from both chart reviews and HRAs relative to their peers.",

HHS allocated $50 billion for a General Distribution to Medicare providers., Providers that receive PRF funds are subject to certain requirements for attestation, submission of revenue information, and reporting of quarterly use-of-funds to HHS.  A provider that received a PRF payment and retained it for at least 90 days without contacting HHS regarding the payment is deemed to have accepted its terms and conditions.  Further, a provider must submit general revenue data after receiving or when applying to receive a payment.  Finally, according to the CARES Act, Division B, Title V, Section 15011(b)(2), no later than 10 days after the end of each calendar quarter, a provider that received more than $150,000 in total funds for the coronavirus response and related activities shall submit a report to HHS regarding the use of those funds., As part of the OIG's oversight of the $50 billion General Distribution of the PRF, we will provide a snapshot of the effectiveness of the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA's) controls over Medicare providers' compliance with the attestation, submitted-revenue-information, and quarterly use-of-funds reporting requirements.

Because of economic and other uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the shelter-in-place orders in effect for most States, abusers may exert further power and control over their partners.  Victims in these States are more socially isolated and have fewer opportunities to connect with others who may be able to assist them.  Isolated victims may be less likely to use crisis hotlines because their abusers are close by, and victims may face repercussions if they reach out for help.  For fiscal year 2020, the Administration for Children and Families allocated $12 million for the National Domestic Violence Hotline (the Hotline).  The Hotline operates a 24-hour, national, toll-free, and confidential telephone hotline for victims of domestic violence.  It maintains a comprehensive resource database on services for these victims and is the only 24/7 center in the Nation that has access to service providers and shelters across the United States.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act provided additional funding of $2 million for the Hotline, including hotline services provided remotely.  Our objectives are to identify: (1) trends with the Hotline data that occurred during nationwide shelter-in-place orders and (2) whether the Hotline faced challenges that occurred during States' shelter-in-place orders and actions it has taken to address these challenges while continuing to support those affected by domestic violence.",

It is critical to ensure safe and accessible health care for AI/ANs during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Prior OIG work found that IHS facilities often lack sufficient clinical and other staff, and identified numerous problems caused by staffing shortages, including limited patient access to specialists and problems with the use of contracted staff.  The COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate staffing shortages as IHS and Tribal hospitals continue to see more COVID-19 patients.  As a response, IHS contracted additional staff by forming a Critical Care Response Team pilot program, which is designed to provide urgent medical care for COVID-19 patients in facilities with insufficient staffing.  The teams are also charged with preparing and training frontline health care staff on evidence-based and best practices, supporting clinical decision making, and providing consultations and advice on hospital operations and how to manage critically ill patients.  As of September 29, 2020, IHS had deployed five teams to provide services at six IHS-operated facilities and three tribally operated facilities and planned to make the program a longer-term part of IHS operations.  Doing so could help remedy longstanding staffing shortages at IHS facilities.  However, problems identified in prior OIG work indicate that IHS may have difficulty managing this contracted resource and integrating the teams into facility practices.  OIG's review will use interviews with IHS and contracted staff, as well as document reviews, to assess IHS use of the Critical Care Response Teams, including development, management, and oversight of the teams, and IHS selection criteria for determining which facilities would receive deployments.

Instead of billing the stays as inpatient claims, they should have been billed as outpatient claims, which usually results in a lower payment.  To reduce inpatient admission errors, CMS implemented the Two-Midnight Rule in fiscal year 2014.  Under the Two-Midnight Rule, CMS generally considered it inappropriate to receive payment under the inpatient prospective payment system for stays not expected to span at least two midnights.  The only procedures excluded from the rule were newly initiated mechanical ventilation and any procedures appearing on the Inpatient Only List.  Revisions were made to the Two-Midnight Rule after its implementation.  We plan to audit hospital inpatient claims after the implementation of and revisions to the Two-Midnight Rule to determine whether inpatient claims with short lengths of stay were incorrectly billed as inpatient and should have been billed as outpatient or outpatient with observation.  We also plan to review policies and procedures for enforcing the Two-Midnight Rule at the administrative level and contractor level.  While OIG previously stated that it would not audit short stays after October 1, 2013, this serves as notification that the OIG will begin auditing short stay claims again, and when appropriate, recommend overpayment collections.

It was found that none of the $51.6 million we reviewed, representing 129,792 claims, should have been paid because the inpatient facilities were responsible for payments.  In addition, beneficiaries were held responsible for unnecessary deductibles and coinsurance totaling $14.3 million paid to acute-care hospitals for those outpatient services.  In addition, it was found that Medicare overpaid acute-care hospitals because the common working file (CWF) edits that should have prevented or detected the overpayments were not working properly., Federal regulations state that the inpatient hospital services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are paid under Medicare Part A.  These include inpatient stays at LTCHs, IRFs, and IPFs.  Federal regulations also state that Medicare does not pay any provider other than the inpatient hospital for services provided to the beneficiary while the beneficiary is an inpatient of the hospital.

HRSA should identify and mitigate risks related to awarding grants to health centers in order to minimize the potential misuse or loss of Federal funds, as required by the HHS Grants Policy Administration Manual, Part F, Chapter 4.a.1.  In spring 2020, HRSA awarded through three programs nearly $2 billion to approximately 1,380 health centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  To expedite distribution of this funding, HRSA did not require that health centers apply for grants.  Instead, it made funds immediately available to health centers.  Health centers had 30 days from the award release date to submit the information that is usually submitted, reviewed, and approved during the grant application process prior to a grantee receiving funding.  The information that each of the health centers provided included a program narrative, a budget and budget narrative, and a list of equipment to be purchased, if applicable.  We will determine whether HRSA had an effective process for identifying and monitoring high-risk health centers that received COVID-19 grant funds. 	",

COVID-19, the disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that had not been previously identified in humans, first emerged in China in December 2019, and the first reported U.S. case occurred in January 2020.  Because of the rapid worldwide spread of the virus, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic in March 2020.  To protect the health and safety of the American people and to assist the Department of Health and Human Services and its Federal partners, laboratories began to provide COVID-19 testing to identify individuals who had contracted the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  Laboratory testing for both COVID-19 tests and non-COVID-19 tests (i.e., laboratory tests that are not for COVID-19) is important for all Medicare beneficiaries, but may be especially important for beneficiaries with certain medical conditions who are identified to be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.  Ensuring individuals receive necessary laboratory tests is critical to improving health care quality and containing long-term health costs., Our preliminary analysis has shown that the number of non-COVID-19 tests billed for Medicare Part B beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased compared with the 6-month period before the pandemic, and many independent laboratories have encountered challenges in providing COVID-19 testing.  We will conduct a series of audits on Medicare Part B laboratory services during the pandemic that will initially focus on the effect of the pandemic on non-COVID-19 testing.  The series of audits will also focus on aberrant billing of COVID-19 testing during the pandemic.",

The Indian Health Service (IHS) has issued its COVID-19 Pandemic Vaccine Plan detailing how the IHS health care system will distribute, allocate, and administer the COVID-19 vaccine.  The CDC recommended that all jurisdictions be prepared to immediately vaccinate identified critical populations as the earliest COVID-19 vaccine doses became available and were granted emergency use authorization.  IHS is recognized as a ""coordinator,"" similar to a State or other jurisdiction, for vaccine distribution.  Tribal Health Programs and Urban Indian Organizations had the option to receive vaccines through either the IHS or their State.  IHS direct facilities receive the vaccine through IHS.  Approximately 338 facilities elected to receive vaccines through the IHS (including IHS direct facilities, Tribal Health Programs, and Urban Indian Organizations).  We will focus on IHS's coordination of the distribution, allocation, and administration of the vaccine to Tribal Health Programs.  The objective of this audit is to determine whether IHS followed the Memorandum of Agreement for the CDC COVID-19 Federal Agency Vaccination Program and the IHS COVID-19 Pandemic Vaccine Plan to coordinate the distribution, allocation, and administration of the vaccines to Tribal Health Programs to protect AI/AN beneficiaries.  This objective will allow us to review the OIG priority area of promoting public health and safety with respect to services provided to the vulnerable population served by IHS.  It will also allow us to address particularly critical goals that bear directly upon OIG's mission and that are identified in the OIG Strategic Plan: Oversight of COVID-19 Response and Recovery.  These goals include protecting the health and safety of the AI/AN population that receives health care services through IHS programs and identifying opportunities to increase the effectiveness of IHS's COVID-19 response.  We will review the policies and procedures that IHS had in place during our audit period and evaluate the measures implemented by Tribal Health Programs during Phases 1a and 1b of their vaccination programs—specifically, the measures to distribute, allocate, and administer the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna—for the period of December 11, 2020, through February 28, 2021.

The National Institutes of Health recently warned that individuals with opioiduse disorder could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, which is a respiratory virus that attacks the lungs.  Respiratory disease is known to increase mortality risks among people taking opioids.  This data brief would provide information on opioid utilization among beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Part D in 2020.  It would build on our series of reports, including the recent data snapshot Opioid Use in Medicare Part D During the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic (OEI-02-20-00400), which reviewed opioid use in Part D during the first 8 months of 2020.

Generally, Medicare payments for global surgery procedures include payments for necessary preoperative and postoperative services related to surgery when furnished by a surgeon.  Medicare global surgery rules define the rules for reporting E/M services with minor surgery and other procedures covered by these rules.  In general, E/M services provided on the same day of service as a minor surgical procedure are included in the payment for the procedure.  The decision to perform a minor surgical procedure is included in the payment for a minor surgical procedure and must not be reported separately as an E/M service.  An E/M service should be billed only on the same day if a surgeon performs a significant and separately identifiable E/M service that is unrelated to the decision to perform a minor surgical procedure.  In this instance, the provider should append a modifier 25 to the appropriate E/M code.  In 2019, about 56 percent of dermatologists' claims with an E/M service also included minor surgical procedures (such as lesion removals, destructions, and biopsies) on the same day.  This may indicate abuse whereby the provider used modifier 25 to bill Medicare for a significant and separately identifiable E/M service when only a minor surgical procedure and related preoperative and postoperative services are supported by the beneficiary's medical record.  We will determine whether dermatologists' claims for E/M services on the same day of service as a minor surgical procedure complied with Medicare requirements.",

Three drugs—Harvoni, Epclusa, and Mavyret—accounted for 93 percent of expenditures, with annual Medicare costs ranging from $28,000 to $77,000 per beneficiary.  A portion of these totals was shared by Medicare beneficiaries who faced thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs for hepatitis C drugs under Part D.  In early 2019, Gilead—the manufacturer of Harvoni and Epclusa—launched authorized generic versions of both drugs with the expressed goal of reducing patients' outofpocket costs.  The retail price of authorized generic versions is $24,000, which is significantly less than the prices of Harvoni and Epclusa, and even less than Mavyret.  These lower list prices should in turn lead to lower out-of-pocket costs, as authorized generics are as effective as branded versions but sell for only a fraction of the cost.  However, a preliminary analysis indicates that Medicare utilization has not shifted from brandname versions of Harvoni and Epclusa to their significantly cheaper, authorized generic versions or to Mavyret.  This study will examine the utilization of hepatitis C drugs under Part D and the financial impact on Medicare Part D and beneficiaries.",

To prevent and mitigate future outbreaks, it is important that we understand how nursing homes experienced the COVID-19 pandemic. This nationwide, three-part study will examine how the pandemic affected nursing homes. The first part will analyze the extent to which Medicare beneficiaries residing in nursing homes were diagnosed with COVID-19 and describe the characteristics of those who were at greater risk. The second part will describe the characteristics of the nursing homes that were hardest hit by the pandemic (i.e., homes with high numbers of beneficiaries who had COVID-19). The third part will describe the strategies nursing homes used to mitigate the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19. These challenges include procuring critical supplies, testing residents and staff, isolating high numbers of contagious residents, caring for those afflicted, and protecting residents and staff on a scale never before experienced in this country.",
May 2021,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Impact of Expanding the Hospital Transfer Payment Policy for Early Discharges to Postacute Care,Office of Audit Services,W-00-21-35871,2022,https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000585.asp,"We will determine how the hospital transfer policy for early discharges to postacute care (PAC) would financially affect Medicare and hospitals if it were expanded to include all Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Groups (MS-DRGs).  The transfer payment policy for discharges from hospitals to PAC facilities, such as a skilled nursing facility, applies to certain specified MS-DRGs.  Analysis of Medicare claims data demonstrates significant occurrences of early discharges from hospitals to PAC facilities for MS-DRGs that are not currently subject to the PAC transfer payment policy.  Medicare pays a full prospective payment system (PPS) rate to hospitals for these early discharges.  In contrast, Medicare pays hospitals a reduced payment for shorter lengths of stay for certain MS-DRGs when beneficiaries are transferred to PAC settings (42 CFR § 412.4(f)).  Our proposed audit would provide CMS with a more updated analysis of the financial impact that an expanded hospital-to-PAC transfer payment policy (i.e., all MS-DRGs) would have on Medicare and hospitals.

In recent years, multiple hospitals have fallen prey to significant cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic that have impacted hospital operations and patient care. In October 2020, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)issued a joint cybersecurity advisory regarding ransomware activity targeting the health care and public health sector.  The advisory stated that threat actors have continued to develop new functionality and tools, thereby increasing the ease, speed, and profitability of ransomware attacks. HHS-OIG will audit HHS's governance over its programs to determine whether HHS's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has performed periodic audits of hospitals to assess compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act(HIPAA) Security, Privacy, and Breach Notification rules and determine whether these audits effectively assessed ePHI protections.

Revised,Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Accuracy of Place-of-Service Codes on Claims for Medicare Part B Physician Services When Beneficiaries Are Inpatients Under Part A,Office of Audit Services,W-00-21-35872; W-00-22-35872,2022,https://oig.hhs.gov/reports-and-publications/workplan/summary/wp-summary-0000600.asp,"Generally, Medicare makes payments under Part B for physician services and payments under Part A for the costs of inpatient stays at inpatient facilities such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and hospitals.  While Medicare pays both SNFs and hospitals through prospective payment systems for the costs of inpatient stays, physician services provided to SNF and hospital inpatients are paid according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.  The amount Medicare pays physician service providers (such as physicians, podiatrists, and nurse practitioners, referred to collectively as ""physicians"") can vary based on where the service is provided (such as a SNF, hospital, or physician's office).  Physician services can include medical and surgical procedures, office visits, and medical consultations.  Fee schedule payments for physician services are based on three major categories of physician costs: practice expense, physician work, and malpractice insurance.  The practice expense is intended to cover overhead costs involved in providing a service.  To account for different practice expenses that physicians incur at different settings, Medicare designates a nonfacility rate and a facility rate for each service within the fee schedule. Because physicians generally incur higher practice expenses by performing services in their offices and other nonfacility settings such as independent clinics and urgent care facilities, Medicare generally reimburses physicians at a higher nonfacility rate for services performed in these settings.  For services performed at a facility setting such as a SNF or hospital, Medicare generally reimburses physicians for services at a lower facility rate, and the prospective payment system payment to the facility covers the overhead expense.  Physicians indicate the applicable place of service on a Medicare claim using a two-digit place-of-service code to ensure that Medicare properly reimburses the physician at either the nonfacility rate or the facility rate.  The physical setting where a physician performs a service does not always determine the appropriate place-of-service code.  For example, when a beneficiary is a registered inpatient at a hospital or SNF, physician services should always be coded with a facility place-of-service code and paid at the facility rate.  This is irrespective of the setting where the patient actually receives the facetoface encounter.  Our preliminary data analysis indicates that during 2018 and 2019, Medicare may have paid a significant number of Part B physician service claim lines at the nonfacility rate when the beneficiary was a Part A inpatient at either a hospital or SNF.  We will determine whether Medicare appropriately paid claims for Part B physician services based on the correct place-of-service code when a beneficiary was an inpatient at a SNF or hospital. ",

Primary care providers play a critical role in screening patients for intimate partner violence and referring patients who screen positive to support services.  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has a recommendation that clinicians screen for intimate partner violence in women of reproductive age and provide or refer women who screen positive to ongoing support services.  Despite this recommendation, primary care providers may encounter barriers to screening—including lack of knowledge, time constraints, and lack of adequate compensation.  Medicaid expansion programs must provide coverage of certain preventive services recommended by USPSTF including screening for intimate partner violence, and States may opt to cover this preventive service in their traditional Medicaid programs.  However, there are no specific procedure codes for providers to bill for time spent screening for intimate partner violence and making referrals to support services.  This evaluation will determine whether and how primary care providers who serve Medicaid enrollees screen for intimate partner violence and make referrals to support services.  We also expect this work to identify opportunities to improve these screening and referral practices.",

Telehealth has helped ensure access to care while reducing the risk of community spread of the virus.  As the effects of the pandemic are still being felt throughout the Nation, there are questions about how telehealth can best be used to meet the needs of beneficiaries in the future.  HHS-OIG will work with the other OIG members in and leadership of the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) to produce a report describing the types of telehealth services that are available, including those that were expanded during the pandemic, and key program integrity risks associated with the use of telehealth across six selected Federal health care programs.  Medicare is the HHS program included in this evaluation.  HHS-OIG will conduct this evaluation with OIGs from the departments of Defense, Justice, Labor, and Veterans Affairs, and the Office of Personnel Management.  PRAC will issue the resulting report.  It will provide policymakers and stakeholders with foundational information about the nature of telehealth across select Federal health care programs and related program integrity risks in order to inform the use of telehealth in the future.

To date, HHS-OIG has conducted 21 audits of grantees in 8 countries on 2 continents (Africa and Asia).  OIG's PEPFAR oversight has helped grant recipients learn important grant and program integrity lessons that apply to ongoing and future responses to infectious diseases.  In previous audits of foreign PEPFAR grantees, OIG identified unallowable expenditures, inadequate accounting systems, and internal control weaknesses.  We will determine whether selected foreign or domestic grantees: (1) managed and expended PEPFAR funds in accordance with award requirements, and (2) have controls to mitigate potential risk to the PEPFAR program.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has the lead responsibility for policy development and implementation of the VFC program.  CDC buys vaccines at a discount and distributes them to grantees-i.e., State health departments and certain local and territorial public health agencies-which in turn distribute them at no charge to those private physicians' offices and public health clinics registered as VFC providers.  To ensure the quality of VFC vaccines and the integrity of the VFC program, CDC requires grantees to conduct: (1) an enrollment site visit for all new and re-enrolling VFC providers before they receive VFC vaccines; (2) compliance site visits for all enrolled and active VFC providers every 24 months; and (3) unannounced storage and handling site visits at a minimum of 5 percent of VFC providers during the cooperative agreement budget period.  Site visits help determine provider compliance with VFC Program requirements, including adherence to vaccine eligibility screening and documentation, accountability, and management.  We will conduct an audit to determine whether CDC VFC grantees conducted site visits at enrolled and active VFC program providers that provide routine childhood vaccines (not COVID-19 vaccines) according to program requirements.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will identify alternative procedures or approaches that grantees may have taken to complete site visits.  ",

Buprenorphine is the most commonly used medication to treat opioid use disorder and has been shown to decrease illicit opioid use and opioid-related overdose deaths.  However, it also has a risk of diversion.  To address this risk, providers must obtain a waiver through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to prescribe or administer buprenorphine in office-based settings.  In April 2021, the Biden-Harris Administration released its drug policy priority areas for its first year, which include removing unnecessary barriers to prescribing buprenorphine and identifying opportunities to expand low-barrier treatment services.  As the Department and the Administration consider additional changes to the requirements regarding buprenorphine, it is important to balance the need to increase access while minimizing diversion.

These services include both home-delivered meals and meals served in group settings (congregate settings), such as senior centers and faith-based locations.  In March 2020, many State and local governments across the country instituted stay-at-home orders that confined individuals to their homes except to shop for essentials or seek medical attention.  Because seniors were at a higher risk of hospitalization and death due to complications of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised them to have limited interactions with the general public.  Consequently, many of the congregate meal locations closed, and those that did not were cautioned to prioritize safety for clients and providers.  Thus, COVID-19 increased the need for home-delivered meals.  On April 21, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided approximately $480 million for the OAA Nutrition Services Program to expand ""drive-through"" or ""grab-and-go"" meals for older adults who previously would have participated in congregate meal programs.  Our audit will determine whether CARES Act OAA Nutrition Services Program funds were used in accordance with Federal and State requirements.",

Data reported by nursing homes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network identified that COVID-19 infections among nursing home residents were higher in nursing homes with lower vaccination coverage among staff. The data also indicates that while nursing homes have made significant progress in vaccinating their residents, approximately one in five nursing home staff were not vaccinated as of the end of 2021. CMS amended Federal regulations at 42 CFR § 483.80 to require that nursing home staff be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The regulations allow nursing homes to grant staff exemptions from the vaccination requirements based on Federal law (e.g., for specific medical and religious reasons). The regulations, among other things, also require nursing homes to track and securely document the vaccination status of staff, exemptions requested, and exemptions granted. The effective date of the regulations varies by State, but all States must be in compliance by March 21, 2022.  Through a series of audits, we will determine whether nursing homes nationwide are in compliance with the regulations and identify the COVID-19 vaccination status of their staff members.",

States may then use CMS-approved waivers to have Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) provide care to Medicaid beneficiaries. Under these arrangements, States make capitation payments to the MCOs in return for the MCOs providing the patient care for the Medicaid beneficiaries. Some States place limitations on MCOs' earnings, for example, limiting the profits they may earn or requiring a certain percentage of their revenues to be spent on medical expenses. States with such limitations may require the MCOs to return a portion of the capitation payments when the MCOs exceed those limitations. According to the Act, § 1903(d)(3)(A) States are required to refund to the Federal Government the Federal share of any amounts recovered during any fiscal quarter. Additionally, 45 CFR § 75.406(a) requires recipients of Federal awards (which includes State Medicaid agencies) to credit to the Federal award the Federal share of reduction-of-expenditure type transactions, such as rebates, purchase discounts, or allowances when those transactions relate to allowable costs.

In most States, a single State agency performs the day-to-day operations, but in others counties operate the program, and States administer it. Program responsibilities include locating noncustodial parents-those who are not the primary caregivers or do not have custody or control -, establishing paternity and support orders, and collecting and distributing child support payments. Costs to carry out these responsibilities are administrative and uncapped, so the Federal share of the program increases as States spend more on program administration. Based on a risk assessment, we will select States for review to determine whether program administrative costs claimed were allowable and allocable in accordance with Federal and State requirements.",

The per diem payment cannot exceed the full payment that would have been made if the beneficiary had been discharged to home.  A prior OIG review identified Medicare overpayments to hospitals that did not comply with the post-acute-care transfer policy (42 CFR § 412.4(c)).  OIG's review found that the CMS Common Working File (CWF) edits that detected inpatient claims under the post-acute care transfer policy were working appropriately.  However, some Medicare contractors did not receive automatic notifications of improperly billed claims or did not act to adjust those claims.  As a result, OIG recommended that CMS recover the identified overpayments in line with its policies and procedures and ensure that the Medicare contractors are receiving the notifications and are acting to recover the overpayments.  CMS concurred with all OIG recommendations and detailed how they were addressed.  This followup audit will determine whether CMS's CWF edits are working properly in detecting inpatient claims under the post-acute-care transfer policy and are automatically recovering overpayments, and whether Medicare contractors are receiving the automatic notifications and acting to recover overpayments.",

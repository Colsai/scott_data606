0,A-02-17-02005,New York Did Not Have Adequate Oversight of Its Reported Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program Expenditures A-02-17-02005 05-18-2021,"The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program provides grants to States to help low-income families with financial assistance and support for work-related activities, child care, and other services.  As a condition of receiving Federal TANF funds, States are required to spend a certain amount of their own funds (known as State maintenance-of-effort (MOE) funds) on TANF-allowable expenditures.  Effective fiscal year (FY) 2015, States must use a revised form to report their TANF and MOE expenditures quarterly to the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).  Therefore, we decided to review States' compliance with the revised TANF reporting requirements.  We audited New York's compliance because a prior OIG audit of TANF Basic Assistance payments in New York identified significant areas of noncompliance with Federal requirements.  , Our objective was to determine whether New York ensured that its TANF and MOE expenditures reported to ACF met Federal requirements., Our audit covered $4.8 billion in reported TANF and MOE funds expended by New York during 
FY 2016.  We reviewed these expenditures and traced them to summary worksheets.  We also reviewed selected expenditures from two local districts for supporting documentation for the quarter ending September 30, 2016., New York's oversight did not ensure that its reported TANF and MOE expenditures met Federal requirements.  Specifically, although New York timely submitted required expenditure reports to ACF, except for certain State tax credits, it did not ensure the accuracy of the other expenditures reported to ACF.  Rather, New York relied on its local districts and TANF-funded State programs to compile and maintain supporting documentation for its reported expenditures and did not review the documentation., As a result, New York could not ensure that its reported TANF program expenditures for FY 2016, totaling $4.8 billion in TANF and MOE expenditures, met Federal requirements and were used in accordance with the intended purposes of its TANF grant.  Inaccurate reporting of TANF program expenditures could negatively impact ACF's program decision making related to how States use their TANF and MOE funds. , We recommend that New York: (1) work with its local districts and TANF-funded State programs to develop financial management procedures that would enable it to determine if TANF and MOE expenditures are accurately reported to ACF, including the $4.8 billion in TANF and MOE expenditures reported for FY 2016; and (2) improve its oversight of the TANF program by providing additional guidance and training to ensure that its local districts accurately report expenditures and maintain adequate documentation to support TANF and MOE expenditures reported., New York agreed with our recommendations and stated that the recommendations are its currently established practices.  New York stated that it will continue to pursue ways to further strengthen its oversight of the TANF program.  New York also stated that the title of the report is misleading and unfairly mischaracterizes its existing oversight and monitoring policies and practices.  We maintain that our report title, findings and recommendations are valid.  We acknowledge New York's comments about its robust TANF program monitoring function and efforts made to strengthen its oversight of the program.  However, we determined that New York did not have adequate oversight during our audit period to ensure that its reported TANF program expenditures met Federal requirements. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"
1,A-02-16-02009,The Administration for Children and Families Region II Did Not Always Resolve Head Start Grantees' Single Audit Findings in Accordance With Federal Requirements Audit (A-02-16-02009) 02-01-2018,"The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) had a process in place to ensure that Head Start grantees took corrective action on A-133 audit findings.

                Office of Management and Budget Circular A 133 (also known as A-133 audits) for fiscal years beginning before December 26, 2014. However, for Region II Head Start grantees that submitted audit reports to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse,
                ACF did not always resolve recurring audit findings in accordance with Federal requirements and ACF policies and procedures. Specifically, ACF did not issue letters transmitting management decisions for six of the eight audit reports we
                reviewed within 6 months after receiving the reports. In addition, although ACF provided the grantees with letters stating that the corrective actions planned or taken should prevent recurrence of the findings, ACF did not establish specific

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) is responsible for following up on recommendations made to grantees in A 133 audit reports.  We reviewed Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) data for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) Head Start grantees in ACF Regions VI, IX, and X that submitted A-133 audit reports from Federal fiscal years 2013 through 2015.  , ACF had a process in place to ensure that Head Start grantees took corrective action on A-133 audit findings.  However, for AIAN Head Start grantees that submitted audit reports to the FAC, ACF did not always resolve recurring audit findings in accordance with Federal requirements and ACF policies and procedures.  Specifically, ACF did not issue Audit Determination Letters (letters) for 11 of the 14 audit reports we reviewed within 6 months after receiving the reports.  In addition, although ACF provided the grantees with letters stating that the corrective action satisfied the recommendation for which ACF has resolution responsibility, ACF did not always establish specific dates for grantees to correct all deficiencies noted in the audit reports.

The UAC program served between 7,000 and 8,000 children annually from fiscal years (FYs) 2005 through 2011.  In FY 2012, the number of children served in the program increased to 13,625.  In FY 2014, ORR served 57,496 children.  In FY 2015, ORR served 33,726 children., The Children's Village, Inc. (Children's Village), a UAC grantee responsible for caring for children in ORR custody, received $16.7 million in Federal funds for the care and placement of approximately 483 children during our review period.  We selected Children's Village for review because it received the third highest amount of UAC program funding in New York.  , Our objectives were to determine whether Children's Village (1) met applicable requirements for the care and release of children in its custody and (2) claimed only allowable expenditures in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental guidance., We inspected shelter care cottages and reviewed a nonstatistical sample of employee files and a statistical sample of case files for those children who had been released to a sponsor during FY 2015.  We also reviewed a statistical sample of financial transactions. , Children's Village did not always ensure that its facility was free from potentially harmful conditions, did not meet or properly document that it met certain requirements for the care and release of children in its custody, claimed unallowable expenditures, and had inadequate financial management procedures.  Specifically, Children's Village failed to meet or properly document that it had met certain requirements for the care and release of children in its custody in 46 of the 50 case files reviewed.  Additionally, the files for 2 of 20 employees did not contain evidence that Children's Village had performed all required background checks.  , In addition, Children's Village claimed unallowable expenditures totaling at least $2.6 million related to transactions that were not properly approved, allocated, or supported.  Finally, Children's Village did not disburse drawdowns of Federal funds in a timely manner, drew down funds from one UAC grant to cover expenditures related to its other UAC grant, and did not separately track expenditures for its two UAC grants.  , We recommend that Children's Village (1) ensure that its facility is free from potentially harmful conditions, (2) refund to the Federal Government $2.6 million in unallowable grant expenditures, and (3) implement improvements to its financial management system.  We also made a series of other procedural recommendations. , In written comments on our draft report, Children's Village generally concurred with our procedural recommendations and described steps it had taken or planned to take to address them.  Children's Village did not concur with our recommended financial adjustment.

                custody. However, some UAC case files were missing evidence of sponsor background checks and other required documentation. His House claimed only allowable expenditures. However, we identified areas in which His House lacked an efficient
                and effective system of internal controls when administering UAC program funds., As a result, His House (1) might not have followed ORR policies for 652 children regarding sponsor background checks, prompt medical care, provision of appropriate clothing, sponsor placement decisions, post-release services, or the notification
                of the Department of Homeland Security of the child's release to a sponsor and (2) might have placed Federal funds totaling , $9 million at risk of mismanagement or misappropriation., We recommended that His House (1) develop a policy for maintaining UAC case file documentation that would ensure ORR policies and procedures were followed when releasing a child to a sponsor, (2) increase oversight of its reviewing process
                for UAC case files to ensure that all required documentation is maintained in the file, and (3) implement a financial management system that requires adequate identification of the source and application of Federal funds and effective

Further, it could not identify actual expenditures incurred and charged to the UAC program, and did not monitor its subrecipients' and contractors' performance.  Specifically, Lincoln Hall did not adequately meet employer requirements for 27 of 35 employee files reviewed and it did not have evidence of the proper care and release of children in its custody for 70 of 75 children sampled.  In addition, Lincoln Hall could not identify the actual expenditures incurred that comprised the $29.8 million charged to the UAC program, the entire amount that Lincoln Hall received in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and did not ensure that its subrecipients and contractors met the terms and conditions of their agreements.  , As a result, Lincoln Hall may have placed the health and safety of children at risk, may have charged unallowable expenditures to the UAC program, and the services provided by its subrecipients and contractors could have been inadequate.  , We recommended that Lincoln Hall (1) adhere to policies that meet applicable safety requirements for the care and release of children in its custody and maintain supporting documentation, (2) provide documentation to support the $29.8 million of program costs or refund the Federal Government, and (3) develop policies and procedures that adhere to requirements for monitoring subrecipients and contractors.  We also made a series of other procedural recommendations., In written comments on our draft report, Lincoln Hall agreed with many of the audit findings but did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations.

In FY 2015, ORR served 33,726 children., Youth For Tomorrow - New Life Center, Inc. (YFT), a UAC program grantee responsible for caring for children in ORR custody, received $9.2 million in Federal funds during FY 2015 for the care and placement of 266 children.  We selected YFT for audit because of the high amount of Federal funding it received and because it had State licensing office health and safety violations during FYs 2014 and 2015. , The objectives of this audit were to determine whether YFT: (1) met applicable requirements for the care and release of children in its custody and (2) claimed only allowable expenditures in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and Departmental guidance.  , We inspected shelter care residences and reviewed case files for children released to a sponsor during FY 2015.  We also reviewed personnel records, financial transactions, and policies and procedures., YFT did not meet some requirements for the care and release of children in its custody.  Specifically: (1) 85 of the 100 sampled case files had UAC assessments that may not have been conducted within the required timeframe, (2) 42 of the 100 sampled case files either did not have all evidence of the proper release of children or did not meet requirements for the release of children, and (3) 3 of the 25 sampled employee files did not meet pre employment requirements.

8,OEI-09-16-00260,HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement Improved Coordination and Outreach to Promote the Safety and Well-Being of Unaccompanied Alien Children Report (OEI-09-16-00260) 07-31-2017,"Each year, tens of thousands of children without legal status enter the United States unaccompanied by their parents or legal guardians.  These children are referred to as unaccompanied alien children (UAC).  Between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, the number of UAC entering the United States increased dramatically.  Concern for the safety and well-being of these children after their release from Federal custody has risen in recent years, especially in response to cases of human trafficking.  , In response to the influx and ongoing concerns, this Office of Inspector General (OIG) report follows up on a 2008 report on the placement, care, and release of UAC.  In the 2008 report, OIG found a lack of clarity between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding their roles and responsibilities related to UAC.  OIG also found that at the time neither Department checked on children's safety and well being after their release from Federal custody.  OIG recommended that the Departments delineate their roles and responsibilities in a formal agreement., We interviewed officials from HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement and DHS in July and August 2016; reviewed policies, laws, and testimony related to UAC; and examined related HHS data and documentation., Since OIG's 2008 report, HHS and DHS roles and responsibilities related to UAC are now more clearly delineated in Federal law.  Further, HHS has improved its coordination with DHS and increased its efforts to promote the safety and well-being of UAC after their release from HHS custody.  The Departments have signed a formal agreement regarding their coordination and reported that they have increased and improved their communication.  , Additionally, HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has increased its contact with UAC and their adult sponsors after the child's release from HHS custody through three efforts:  (1) case management services for the most vulnerable children and their sponsors, (2) safety and well-being calls to each child and their sponsors 30 days after release, and (3) helplines available to all children and their sponsors.  These efforts allow ORR to identify concerns about the safety of UAC and report such concerns to law enforcement and child protective service agencies for investigation. , In light of Federal law delineating HHS and DHS roles and responsibilities, the Departments' improved coordination, and HHS's increased efforts to promote the safety and well being of UAC, OIG considers its prior recommendation implemented.  However, we recognize that these efforts do not guarantee that all UAC are protected from harm.  UAC are a highly vulnerable population with ongoing threats to their safety and well-being.  We encourage ORR to continue its efforts to contact these children after their release to sponsors and provide case management services for those who are the most vulnerable.  Further, ORR should continue to report any concerns about the safety and well-being of UAC to the local law enforcement and child protective service agencies that have jurisdiction to address such concerns, and to support these agencies in any way possible.  Finally, we encourage ORR to continue its efforts to share information and coordinate with DHS."
9,OEI-12-16-00120,ACF Cannot Ensure That All Child Victims of Abuse and Neglect Have Court Representation OEI-12-16-00120 02-26-2021,"As a condition of grant funding under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), as amended, a State must assure through a certification that it has in effect and is enforcing a State law or operating a Statewide program that includes provisions and procedures requiring that in every case of child abuse or neglect that results in a judicial proceeding, a representative (e.g., an attorney or nonattorney volunteer) is appointed to advocate for the child's best interests.  However, States' annual reporting to ACF suggests that some States may not be appointing a representative for every child victim.  , These factors raise concerns about whether ACF has taken sufficient action to ensure that vulnerable children receive appropriate court representation to protect their best interests., To assess ACF's oversight in selected States, we surveyed and interviewed the 10 States with the largest numbers of child victims of abuse and neglect in fiscal year 2016.  We also summarized ACF officials' interview responses and agency documentation about procedures to oversee CAPTA's requirement for court representation., ACF is responsible for overseeing States' compliance with CAPTA's requirement for court representation.  However, ACF does little to monitor or enforce States' compliance with this requirement, relying instead on States' self-certification.  , ACF officials reported that ACF considers a State compliant as long as the State has assured through a certification that it has in effect provisions and procedures requiring court representation for child victims-regardless of whether the State effectively implements and enforces that requirement.  ACF officials reported that CAPTA does not provide ACF with the authority to look behind State assurances and monitor whether States actually appoint court representatives to all child victims.  , This is concerning because 5 of the 10 States we reviewed indicated that they do not have systems in place to monitor whether all child victims are appointed a court representative.  States also reported numerous challenges that, in some cases, impeded their ability to promptly appoint a court representative to every child victim., ACF officials explained that ACF prioritizes providing States with technical assistance to support compliance rather than penalizing States.  However, none of the States we reviewed received technical assistance from ACF related to the court-representation requirement, and only four were aware that ACF offers such assistance. , We also found that ACF does not receive complete and accurate court-representative data from States, impeding its ability to identify and respond to problems.  Of the 10 States we reviewed, only 2 confirmed the accuracy of the court-representative appointment figures that they voluntarily reported to ACF.  State officials described technical challenges that impede reporting, such as a lack of centralized data systems.  Additionally, some States face challenges related to communication between court or representative program staff and child welfare agency staff.   , We recommend that ACF conduct oversight activities-seeking statutory authority as necessary-to identify, and proactively provide technical assistance to, States that may not appoint a court representative to every child victim.  We also recommend that ACF proactively identify and address obstacles that States face in reporting complete and accurate court-representative data.  ACF did not explicitly concur or nonconcur with our recommendations.  However, ACF asserted a lack of statutory authority to implement our recommendations and stated that our recommended approach is inconsistent with the structure of the CAPTA State grant program.  "
10,OEI-07-15-00380,Treatment Planning and Medication Monitoring Were Lacking for Children in Foster Care Receiving Psychotropic Medication Report  (OEI-07-15-00380) 09-13-2018,"Up to 80 percent of children enter foster care with significant mental health needs.  For children with mental health needs, psychotropic medications (i.e., medication used to treat clinical psychiatric symptoms or mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders) may be effective treatments.  However, these medications can have serious side effects and, as ACF suggests, should be used in conjunction with treatment planning mechanisms and effective medication monitoring., A 2015 OIG report found-based on review of medical records-serious quality-of-care concerns in the treatment of children with psychotropic medications., We selected a sample of 625 children in foster care from the 5 States that had the highest utilization of psychotropic medications in their foster care populations.  On the basis of foster care case file documentation and Medicaid claims data, we determined the extent to which the children in our sample were treated with psychotropic medications in a manner consistent with their respective States' requirements.  Additionally, we compared the five States' requirements for psychotropic medication oversight with treatment planning and medication monitoring practice guidelines from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)., In five States, one in three children in foster care who were treated with psychotropic medications did not receive treatment planning or medication monitoring as required by States.  Additionally, ACF has suggested that States consider practice guidelines from professional organizations, including the AACAP, related to treatment planning and medication monitoring.  We found that State requirements for oversight of psychotropic medication did not always incorporate these professional practice guidelines., Treatment planning is critical to enhancing continuity of care; improving coordination of services between health and child welfare professionals; and reducing the risk of harmful side effects.  Effective medication monitoring can reduce the risk of inappropriate dosing and inappropriate medication combinations., To ensure coordinated care for children in foster care who receive psychotropic medications, we recommend that ACF develop a comprehensive strategy to improve States' compliance with requirements related to treatment planning and medication monitoring for psychotropic medications.  ACF should assist States in strengthening their requirements for oversight of psychotropic medications by incorporating suggested professional practice guidelines for monitoring children at the individual level.  ACF stated that it concurred with some of our recommendations but not others; it did not specify which of the two formal recommendations it agreed with, and which it did not."
11,A-01-16-02500,Some Massachusetts Group Homes for Children in Foster Care Did Not Always Comply With State Health and Safety Requirements Audit (A-01-16-02500) 12-13-2017,"Although the Department of Early Education and Care (State licensing agency) performed the required onsite monitoring at all 30 of the group homes that we reviewed, this onsite monitoring did not ensure that all 30 homes complied with State licensing requirements related to the health and safety of children in foster care.  Our onsite visits to the 30 selected group homes were conducted between May 2, 2016, and May 26, 2016.  Specifically, at the time of our onsite visits, with regards to physical plant and equipment (facilities and equipment), we found that 27 group homes did not comply with 1 or more State requirements for living units, 26 group homes did not comply with one or more State requirements for buildings and grounds, 20 group homes did not comply with 1 or more State requirements related to bathing and toilet facilities, and 11 group homes did not comply with 1 or more State requirements related to toxic substances.  In addition, we found that 15 group homes did not comply with State requirements regarding the care of residents, and 18 group homes did not comply with 1 or more required background records check or fingerprint submission requirements for employees.  , We recommended that Massachusetts (1) work with the State licensing agency to ensure all instances of noncompliance are corrected, (2) consider adding a requirement in future contracts that the group homes conduct repairs and general upkeep within a specified timeframe, (3) increase the frequency of announced visits and consider including unannounced visits as part of its monitoring system, and (4) work with the State licensing agency to implement adequate monitoring controls to ensure that all group home employees who have the potential for unsupervised contact with children receive all of the required background record checks within a specific and reasonable timeframe.  In written comments on our draft report, the State agency concurred with our first, third, and fourth recommendations, and it said that it will take our second recommendation into consideration for future contracts.  In addition, the State agency outlined corrective actions and improved collaboration with the State's Department of Early Education and Care to address our findings and recommendations., <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

Additionally, in a recent series of OIG health and safety audits of State-monitored childcare facilities, we found that the majority of childcare providers in various States had instances of potentially hazardous conditions and noncompliance with State health and safety requirements, including criminal records checks requirements.  , Our objective was to determine whether Ohio's monitoring ensured that foster care group homes complied with State requirements related to the health and safety of children in foster care, as required by Title IV-E of the Social Security Act (the Act)., Of the 154 group homes in Ohio that received foster care Title IV-E funding for calendar year 2015, we selected 30 homes for our review.  We selected these homes based on various factors, including the homes' location, capacity, children in the homes, and operational status.  We conducted unannounced site visits from June 28 through August 11, 2016., Although the State agency conducted the required inspections at all 30 of the group homes that we reviewed, this monitoring did not ensure that the group homes that received funds under Title IV-E of the Act complied with State requirements related to the health and safety of children in foster care, as required by Federal law.  We determined that 19 of the 30 homes that we reviewed did not comply with 1 or more requirements.  Specifically, we found that 17 homes did not always comply with physical and environmental safety requirements, 5 homes did not always comply with required criminal records checks, 4 homes did not always comply with requirements related to fire safety of residential facilities, and 3 homes did not always comply with staff record requirements., We recommend that the State agency (1) ensure that all instances of noncompliance are documented and corrected; (2) ensure that the group homes adhere to all requirements for the health and safety of children by continuing onsite visits; (3) ensure that group homes obtain the required criminal records checks for all employees who provide direct care to children; and (4) consider additional outreach programs for the group homes, such as training and technical assistance in the areas identified as noncompliant., In written comments on our draft report, the State agency stated that it was ""in accordance"" with our first three recommendations and that it concurred with our fourth recommendation.  After receiving our preliminary findings, the State agency stated that it took immediate action to ensure that the instances of noncompliance with health and safety regulations were being corrected and that group homes adhered to all requirements, including those related to criminal records checks for all employees.  The State agency also said that it will provide ongoing individual and group technical assistance to reinforce current mechanisms in place for disseminating State-wide policy on health and safety issues.      , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"
14,A-06-16-07004,Some Oklahoma Group Homes Did Not Always Comply With State Requirements Audit (A-06-16-07004) 9/27/2017,"Although the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (State agency) performed the required onsite monitoring at all 22 group homes, this onsite monitoring did not ensure that foster care group homes complied with State licensing and Federal requirements related to the health and safety of children in foster care.  We determined that 17 of the 22 group homes did not comply with 1 or more State health and safety requirements.  Specifically, we found that 12 of the group homes did not comply with transportation requirements; 12 of the group homes did not comply with building, utilities, and grounds requirements; 10 of the group homes did not comply with fire safety requirements; 4 of the group homes did not comply with food service requirements; 4 of the group homes did not comply with safety and emergency preparedness requirements; and 1 group home did not comply with physical facility and equipment requirements. , We note that certain issues of noncompliance found during our review can frequently occur between State monitoring visits.  However, other issues of noncompliance represent a prolonged period of noncompliance and should have been corrected if those issues had been documented and resolved during the State's monitoring.  These instances of noncompliance with health and safety requirements indicate that the State agency and group homes need to take additional measures to ensure that all issues of noncompliance are documented and resolved in a timely manner and that the group homes clearly understand what is required to safeguard and protect the children in their care. , The State agency completed background checks on all 229 of the employees at the group homes we reviewed., We recommended that the State agency (1) ensure that monitoring staff document and resolve all issues of noncompliance of group homes in a timely manner, (2) require group home staff to complete specific training requirements related to health and safety regulations, and (3) revise the State licensing requirements for the monitoring of vehicles used to transport children to ensure that the State agency monitors all vehicles annually. , In written comments on our draft report, the State agency agreed with the first and second recommendations but disagreed with the third recommendation.  The State agency did not agree that State licensing requirements need to be revised for the monitoring of vehicles.  The State agency stated that licensing staff are trained to monitor vehicles annually and maintenance logs are monitored at each monitoring visit. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

18,OEI-03-15-00170,States' Payment Rates Under the Child Care and Development Fund Program Could Limit Access to Child Care Providers Report  (OEI-03-15-00170) 08-12-2019,"<a data-fancybox="""" href=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/q2f_TnOcJjQ"">Eye on Oversight: Child Care Safety Lapses</a>, The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program, for which fiscal year (FY) 2018 Federal funding totaled $8.2 billion, provides child care subsidies for 1.4 million eligible children.  CCDF program payments, which are administered by States, allow eligible low income parents to work or pursue training or education while their children attend child care.  If States set CCDF payment rates too low, families may not have access to child care providers.  ACF is responsible for overseeing States' CCDF payment rates to child care providers and ensuring that eligible families have equal access to child care services.  The only proxy for ensuring equal access that ACF has recommended to States is setting CCDF payment rates at a level that covers 75 percent of child care provider prices-referred to as the 75th percentile., We surveyed a nationwide sample of licensed child care providers, including centers and family child care homes, to obtain child care pricing for an infant with no special needs.  We compared providers' prices to States' CCDF payment rates and estimated the difference between these amounts.  We surveyed States to examine how they determine that their CCDF payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access to child care services for eligible families.  Lastly, we interviewed ACF staff responsible for CCDF plan oversight to review how ACF ensures that States' CCDF provider payment rates are sufficient to ensure equal access for eligible families., The majority of child care providers charge more for infant care than States' CCDF payment rates.  As a result, CCDF families' access to care may be limited unless they can pay the difference between provider prices and State payment rates.  Operating with finite resources, States must balance competing priorities and perform tradeoffs between raising payment rates, serving eligible families, and ensuring compliance with program requirements.  ACF does not evaluate States' CCDF payment rates, nor does it determine whether States have ensured equal access to child care services for eligible families.  We found that only seven States have set their CCDF payment rates at the level that ACF recommends for ensuring equal access.  The majority of States have implemented provider-friendly payment practices, such as paying providers timely, to incentivize providers to participate in the CCDF program and ensure access for eligible families.  However, some providers still report concerns about payment amounts, payment frequencies, and other administrative burdens associated with CCDF program participation., As only seven States set payment rates at the level ACF recommends, ACF should evaluate whether States are ensuring equal access for CCDF families, as required.  ACF should consider developing additional proxies for equal access-apart from setting rates at the 75th percentile of provider prices-that would allow it to evaluate States' progress toward meeting the requirement.  Additionally, ACF should ensure that States comply with the new requirement to use the results of the most recent market-rate survey, or alternative methodology, to set CCDF payment rates.  To encourage States to learn about and potentially adopt successful practices, ACF should establish a forum for States where, at regular intervals, they can share strategies regarding how they set payment rates to ensure equal access for eligible families while balancing competing program priorities.  Lastly, ACF should encourage States to minimize administrative burdens for CCDF providers, with a goal of encouraging provider participation and expanding access for eligible families.  ACF concurred with all of our recommendations."

20,OEI-04-15-00431,Entities Generally Met Federal Select Agent Program Internal Inspection Requirements But CDC Could Do More To Improve Effectiveness Report (OEI-04-15-00431) 06-25-2018,"Select agents and toxins are potential bioweapons that can cause significant loss of life and economic damage.  Incidents of mishandling select agents and toxins by some entities registered with the Federal Select Agents Program (FSAP) have raised questions about CDC's Division of Select Agents and Toxin's (DSAT) ability to oversee entities' responsible handling of select agents and toxins.  Entities' internal inspections are one critical safeguard to help protect public health and safety.  In this review, OIG examines entities' and DSAT's roles in implementing and overseeing these internal inspections.  This builds on a companion review in which OIG examined DSAT's inspections of entities., We reviewed DSAT data, survey data, and documentation from a purposive sample of 24 DSAT inspectors and 21 entities registered with the FSAP from 2013 through 2015.  We determined whether entities reported conducting internal inspections during this timeframe and whether DSAT cited those entities that did not conduct them.  We asked DSAT inspectors about their challenges in overseeing entities' compliance with the internal inspection requirement and asked entities about their challenges in conducting internal inspections.  , Most entities in our review reported to us that they conducted internal inspections as required.  In nearly all cases, CDC identified and cited those few entities that reported to us they did not  conduct these inspections as required.  These inspections are important tools for protecting public health and safety, and many of them identified potential noncompliance with biosafety and security requirements.  This is consistent with the types of observations that DSAT most commonly found in its inspections, according to a previous HHS OIG report.  However, these inspections may not always be as thorough and well documented as they should be.  Unclear inspection requirements and insufficient training may challenge both DSAT's ability to oversee entities' internal inspections and entities' ability to conduct them and may partially explain why entities' internal inspections are not always sufficiently thorough or sufficiently documented., CDC should take steps to strengthen the effectiveness of entity internal inspections by clarifying the FSAP internal inspection requirements and the procedures for assessing entity compliance, and by developing and providing additional training to both DSAT inspectors and entities on these requirements and procedures.  CDC concurred with all our recommendations. "
21,OEI-04-15-00432,"Entities' Experiences and Perceptions of Reporting the Theft, Loss, and Release of Select Agents or Toxins to CDC Report  (OEI-04-15-00432) 02-27-2018","Congress and the media have devoted attention to several events at laboratories involving the theft, loss, or release (TLR events) of select agents and toxins that have the potential to pose severe threats to public health, such as anthrax or smallpox.  Entities that work with select agents and toxins must report TLR events to the Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP), which is jointly managed by the Department of Health and Human Services' CDC-specifically, CDC's Division of Select Agents and Toxins (DSAT)-and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service., CDC requested that we collect information on entities' experiences and perceptions of reporting TLR events.  The request was spurred by our May 2017 report, <a class=""i"" href=""/oei/reports/oei-04-15-00430.asp"">CDC Generally Met Its Inspection Goals for the Federal Select Agent Program; However, Opportunities Exist To Strengthen Oversight (OEI-04-15-00430)</a>, which found that almost 3 of every 4 entities (201 of 275) reported no TLR events over the 3 year period from 2013 through 2015.  DSAT expressed concern that entities with no reported TLR events for multiple years may be underreporting them and may pose more of a risk than entities that regularly report TLR events., Using data from the National Select Agent Registry (NSAR), we obtained data from 21 entities that had received a Registration Renewal inspection in 2015.  We received Web-based survey responses from these 21 entities, providing information about their experiences in reporting TLR events and their perceptions of obstacles to reporting, actions to encourage reporting, and benefits from reporting.  We also used NSAR data to obtain the observations that DSAT identified in its inspections from 2013 through 2015 related to the requirement to report TLR events.  Finally, we analyzed FSAP regulations, as well as FSAP and DSAT policies and guidance documents, to understand the TLR reporting requirements and DSAT's oversight of them.   , We found that all 21 entities in our review had been registered with the FSAP for at least 6 years, and that two-thirds of them had reported at least 1 TLR event to the FSAP while the remaining one-third had never reported a TLR event.  None of the 21 entities in our review sample had inspection observations that indicated any failure to report TLR events.  Half of the entities in our review said that obstacles to reporting TLR events include a fear of negative consequences and a burdensome, restrictive reporting process.  CDC may be able to better encourage the reporting of TLR events by addressing these obstacles; improving entities' training and guidance; and further fostering a culture of safety within the FSAP that encourages such reporting. , Although our earlier study found that nearly 3 of every 4 entities did not report a single TLR event from 2013 through 2015, we found no evidence to indicate that the 21 entities in our review are underreporting TLR events.  In addition, this report identifies obstacles to reporting TLR events and actions to encourage such reporting that coincide with many of DSAT's ongoing efforts to improve oversight in this area.  "
22,A-02-16-02012,CDC Reimbursed Contractors for Some Unallowable World Trade Center Health Program Administrative Costs Audit (A-02-16-02012) 02-08-2019,"The World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) was established in January 2011 by the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act).  The WTCHP is administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  CDC incurred WTCHP administrative costs by contracting with various entities that provide WTCHP services, including program management, member enrollment, claims processing, data center administration, privacy and security policy services, and outreach., This review was conducted to fulfill Zadroga Act requirements that we review the WTCHP for unreasonable administrative costs., Our objective was to determine whether CDC reimbursed contractors for WTCHP administrative costs that complied with Federal requirements., Our audit covered approximately $54 million in payments made to contractors for WTCHP administrative costs for the period October 2015 through September 2016.  We separated 179 paid contractor invoices into 12,303 invoice line items.  We then selected and reviewed a statistical sample of 234 invoice line items.  In addition, we selected and reviewed a non-statistical sample of eight paid invoices related to fixed-price WTCHP administrative cost contracts., CDC reimbursed contractors for some WTCHP administrative costs that did not comply with Federal requirements.  Specifically, CDC improperly reimbursed contractors for 43 of the 234 invoice line items that we sampled, totaling more than $1 million.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that CDC improperly reimbursed contractors for WTCHP administrative costs totaling $8 million that did not comply with Federal requirements.  In addition, CDC paid contractors for claims management services at different rates.  Our review quantified the impact of this payment differential and determined that CDC could have saved $360,000 if contractors were reimbursed at the lowest negotiated rate.  Finally, we determined that CDC complied with Federal requirements for all eight of the non-statistically selected fixed-price contract invoices. , CDC reimbursed the unallowable administrative costs because it did not ensure that WTCHP contractors' invoices were adequately reviewed and that staff responsible for reviewing the invoices were adequately trained.  The potential cost savings for claims management services not realized were a result of contracting officer representatives not comparing the claims management services rates paid by various contractors to identify potentially unreasonable costs., We recommend that the CDC: (1) recover the $1 million associated with the 43 unallowable sampled items; (2) work with WTCHP contractors to identify and recover the remaining unallowable payments made during the audit period, which are estimated to be $7 million; (3) improve its monitoring of WTCHP contractors' invoices; and (4) review contractor costs for claims management services for reasonableness, which could result in cost savings totaling $360,000., In written comments on our draft report, CDC agreed to recover costs associated with some sampled items and generally agreed with our procedural recommendations and described some of the actions it has taken or is considering to address them.  CDC generally disagreed with our recommendation to identify and recover unallowable payments because it disagrees with some of our findings.  After reviewing CDC's comments and additional documentation that CDC provided, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  , <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cdc.asp"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>"

We reviewed the six cooperative agreements (CoAgs) for the four recipients located in Pretoria and Johannesburg, South Africa, during the audit period.  During the audit period, CDC awarded six CoAgs totaling $32 million to the four recipients.  Our focus was on the implementation of our prior recommendation during fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017., CDC-SA generally implemented corrective actions for the recommendation from our prior audit report.  CDC-SA provided documentation supporting that it had monitored most of its recipient CoAgs.  However, CDC-SA was still missing some documentation supporting its remaining monitoring activities.  In our current audit, three of the six CoAgs that CDC-SA monitors contained five monitoring activities that were not supported by documentation., The documentation deficiencies we identified occurred primarily because CDC-SA did not always use a CoAg tracking process, such as a grant file checklist, that staff members could fill out at the end of a CoAg budget period to ensure that CDC-SA had completed and filed in a timely manner all required documentation of reviews.  Additionally, CDC-SA did not periodically review and update its standard operating procedures to include changes and specific procedures for monitoring the recipient CoAgs., We recommend that CDC-SA (1) continue to strengthen its CoAg tracking process by consistently completing a grant file checklist at the end of the CoAg's budget period and (2) update and review its SOPs annually to include specific and clear procedures when changes in control activities occur for monitoring recipient CoAgs., In written comments on our draft report, CDC-SA concurred with our recommendations and provided information on actions that it would take to address our recommendations, such as:, Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cdc.asp"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>"

We conducted a series of audits of organizations receiving PEPFAR funds from HHS, Centers
                for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). , Our objectives were to determine whether the South African National Department of Health (the Ministry) (1) managed and expended PEPFAR funds in accordance with award requirements and (2) implemented recommendations from our prior audit. In
                addition to our objectives regarding the Ministry, we collaborated with the Global Fund OIG to determine whether the Global Fund and CDC funded the same PEPFAR activities. The Global Fund is a partnership among governments, civil society,
                the private sector, and people affected by diseases. , Our audit covered the budget periods from April 1, 2014, through March 31, 2016. These budget periods were for years 1 and 2 of a 5-year cooperative agreement. During the budget period under review, CDC awarded the Ministry $5.8 million, of
                which the Ministry expended $2.6 million. From these PEPFAR expenditures, we selected a judgmental sample of 50 financial transactions totaling $670,030., The Ministry did not always manage and expend PEPFAR funds in accordance with award requirements. Of the 50 financial transactions in our judgmental sample, 46 transactions totaling $655,374 were allowable, but 4 transactions totaling $14,656
                were not. These transactions were unallowable because either the Ministry did not provide adequate supporting documentation, such as invoices or attendance rosters, or it paid unallowable value-added taxes (VAT) with PEPFAR funds. Additionally,
                the Ministry did not accurately identify expenses between cooperative agreements in its financial management reporting system, did not submit an accurate Federal Financial Report (FFR), and filed one of its FFRs more than 5 months late.

To meet this requirement, we have conducted a series of audits of
                organizations receiving PEPFAR funds from HHS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). , The objective of our audit was to determine whether the National Institute of Health in Mozambique (the Institute), located in Maputo, Mozambique, managed and expended PEPFAR funds in accordance with the award requirements. , Our audit covered the budget periods from September 30, 2011, through March 31, 2016. These budget periods were for a 5-year cooperative agreement. During the budget period under review, CDC awarded the Institute $9 million, of which it expended
                $8.5 million. From these PEPFAR fund expenditures, we selected a judgmental sample of 50 transactions totaling $1.3 million., The Institute did not always manage and expend PEPFAR funds in accordance with award requirements. Among the most significant problems, the Institute was unable to reconcile its accounting records to the $8.5 million that it claimed on its
                Federal Financial Report (FFR) for the audit period. Of the $1.3 million we reviewed, $623,637 was allowable, but $431,458 was unallowable and $291,185 was for unsupported personnel costs. Additionally, the Institute classified transactions
                totaling $795,295 in the wrong budget category. Finally, the Institute did not have a functioning accounting system and did not have a time and attendance system to support $1.3 million in PEPFAR-funded personnel costs., We recommended that the Institute (1) refund to CDC $431,458 of unallowable expenditures, (2) implement an accounting system that allows it to accurately account for Federal funds, and (3) work with CDC to determine the allowability of the
                $1.3 million in personnel costs expended during the audit period. We also made other policy and procedural recommendations. , In addition, we provided a memorandum to CDC to alert it of the potential risk of fraud, waste, and abuse that PEPFAR funds could be subjected to in the event of future awards. CDC responded to the memorandum and described controls that it
                put in place to monitor the funds., Although the Institute did not specifically concur with any of our recommendations in its written comments on our draft report, it described some of the actions it had taken, or planned to take, to address all but our first recommendation.
                The Institute partially agreed with our first recommendation to refund transactions that were unallowable or inadequately supported. Along with its comments on our first recommendation, the Institute provided additional supporting documentation

                our previous audit. , Our audit covered the budget periods from September 30, 2012, through March 31, 2016. During the budget period under review, CDC awarded Aurum $52.8 million, of which Aurum expended $51.1 million. From these PEPFAR fund expenditures, we selected
                a stratified statistical sample of 70 transactions totaling $2.0 million., On the basis of our sample results, we concluded that Aurum managed and expended PEPFAR funds in accordance with the award requirements. However, it did not always maintain segregation of duties among different personnel within the organization.
                Additionally, Aurum used a procurement-management system that did not allow it to record an invoice with multiple items as a single transaction to the general ledger. Finally, Aurum implemented corrective actions for all five recommendations
                from our previous audit. , The deficiencies we identified occurred because Aurum did not have the necessary financial staff to manage the extra duties and responsibilities that arose from its accelerated growth and because its procurement-management system had limited
                compatibility with its accounting system., We recommended that Aurum continue to (1) implement segregation of duties among different key personnel and (2) upgrade its procurement and accounting systems to effectively track procurements., In written comments on our draft report, Aurum concurred with our recommendations and described some of the actions it had taken, or planned to take, to address them. Examples include reorganizing the financial service to segregate duties
                and responsibilities among key personnel in the financial process and investigating upgrades and alternatives to the procurement management and accounting systems., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cdc.asp"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>"

For drugs that were eligible for rebates, Arizona did not bill for estimated rebates of $18.3 million (Federal share) for single-source and top-20 multiple-source physician-administered drugs.  For drugs that may have been eligible for rebates, Arizona did not bill for estimated rebates of $7.3 million (Federal share) for other physician-administered drugs.

We identified drugs that had not been billed by New Mexico and worked with New Mexico to calculate the amount of rebates that would have been collected from manufacturers had it billed them for the drugs., New Mexico properly billed manufacturers for all pharmacy rebates and some rebates for physician-administered drugs.  However, New Mexico did not bill for and collect from manufacturers rebates for 70,131 claim lines totaling at least $1.5 million ($1.1 million Federal share) for physician-administered drugs.  In addition, the State agency did not bill for rebates for 183,859 claim lines for other physician-administered drugs that may have been eligible for rebates.  These errors occurred because the State agency's internal controls did not always ensure that it billed manufacturers to secure rebates and because the State agency did not always collect the utilization data necessary to bill the manufacturers. , We recommend that New Mexico (1) bill for and collect manufacturers' rebates for the 44,790 claim lines related to single-source and top-20 multiple-source physician-administered drugs that we calculated to be at least $1.2 million ($900,971 Federal share) and refund the Federal share of rebates collected; (2) work with CMS to determine whether the 25,341 claim lines related to non-top-20 multiple-source physician-administered drugs that we calculated to be at least $226,644 ($164,793 Federal share) were eligible for rebates and, if so, determine the rebates due and, upon receipt of the rebates, refund the Federal share of rebates collected; and (3) work with CMS to determine whether the other physician-administered drugs, associated with 183,859 claim lines and rebates of at least $170,674 ($124,097 Federal share), were eligible for rebates and, if so, determine the rebates due and, upon receipt of the rebates, refund the Federal share of the rebates collected.

Because the information we received from Colorado lacked NDC-level detail, we identified the physician-administered drugs that would have been eligible for a drug rebate and calculated that Colorado did not invoice for, and collect from manufacturers, an estimated $2 million ($1 million Federal share) in rebates that were associated with these physician-administered drugs.  We are recommending that Colorado work with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine the total amount of claims that were eligible for rebate and the unallowable portion of these claims.  Although Colorado contractually required the MCOs to obtain NDCs so that drug rebates could be invoiced, the MCOs did not obtain from the providers NDC-level detail that Colorado needed to invoice for rebates for physician-administered drugs.  This occurred because Colorado did not have policies and procedures in place to ensure that the MCOs obtained sufficiently detailed data to properly rebate for physician-administered drugs., We recommend that Colorado work with CMS to determine the total amount of claims that were eligible for rebates as well as the unallowable portion of the physician-administered drug claims, invoice drug manufacturers for the calculated rebates, and refund the Federal share of rebates collected for the years covered by our audit period and for years after our audit period.  We also recommend that Colorado develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all eligible physician-administered drugs, including those dispensed to MCO enrollees, are invoiced for rebate., Colorado agreed with both of our recommendations and described corrective actions it had taken or planned to take.  Colorado said that it would work with CMS to determine the total amount of physician-administered drug encounters that were eligible for rebates but were not invoiced because of missing NDC numbers.  Colorado added that it would work with the MCOs to collect the missing NDC numbers, invoice drug manufacturers, and refund the Federal share of rebates collected.  For our second recommendation, Colorado stated that it would strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that physician-administered drugs are appropriately invoiced for rebate., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

As part of a Medicaid risk assessment, we noted that Virginia claimed $342.6 million
                ($220 million Federal share) for Medicaid administrative costs associated with Virginiaï¿½s Medicaid Managed Care Medallion 3.0 waiver program for State fiscal years (SFYs) 2016 and 2017. We conducted this audit because of the significant
                amount that Virginia claimed and because of our previous findings related to Medicaid administrative costs. , Our objective was to determine whether Virginia claimed Medicaid administrative costs for its waiver program for SFYs 2016 and 2017 in accordance with Federal requirements. , We reviewed Virginiaï¿½s supporting documentation to determine whether the administrative costs claimed for the waiver program were identified in Virginiaï¿½s Cost Allocation Plan (CAP), whether the administrative costs claimed were directly related
                to the administration of the waiver program, and whether the administrative costs claimed were allocated according to the approved CAP methodology., Of the $342.6 million ($220 million Federal share) in administrative costs claimed for Virginiaï¿½s waiver program in SFYs 2016 and 2017, Virginia correctly claimed $324.9 million ($211.2 million Federal share). However, we found that Virginia
                claimed $15.3 million ($7.7 million Federal share) in unallowable waiver program administrative costs not identified in the CAP. In addition, Virginia incorrectly claimed $2.3 million ($1.2 million Federal share) in administrative costs
                that were misclassified as waiver program administrative costs. The misclassified expenditures did not directly benefit the waiver program but directly benefited a separate public welfare program, Virginiaï¿½s Childrenï¿½s Health Insurance
                Program (CHIP). , We recommend that Virginia (1) refund to the Federal Government $7.7 million for administrative costs that were not identified in the CAP and (2) reclassify $2.3 million ($1.2ï¿½million Federal share) in administrative costs that directly benefited
                Virginiaï¿½s CHIP program and not the waiver program. In written comments on our draft report, the State agency agreed to reclassify administrative costs that directly benefited the Stateï¿½s CHIP program and not the waiver program. The State
                agency did not concur with our recommendation that it refund $7.7ï¿½million in questioned costs. The State agency stated that only one section of its CAP contained cost centers, and that the section addressed personnel costs only. The State
                agency contended that only personnel-related cost centers (i.e., cost centers 018, 041, 068, and 090C) should have been included in the CAP. The State agency stated that any disallowance should be limited to personnel-related costs allocated
                to these omitted cost centers, reducing the potential disallowance to $607,529. In addition, the State agency contended that no disallowance is required because Federal law allows retroactive approval of corrections for a deficient CAP.
                The State agency requested a retroactive revision of its CAP on November 17, 2017; as of March 30, 2018, the revision had not been approved. After reviewing the State agencyï¿½s comments, we maintain that our disallowance recommendation
                is valid. The Departmental Appeals Board and Federal regulations require State agencies to include all of their program administrative costs, not just personnel costs, in their CAPs. However, the costs associated with the remaining missing
                cost centers we identified in our findings were not included anywhere in the CAP. We acknowledge that some costs might be allowable if the State agency receives retroactive approval of amendments to its CAP. However, the State has not
                received such approval."

Our objective was to determine whether New York claimed Medicaid reimbursement for NHTD waiver program services in accordance with certain Federal and State requirements., Our review covered New York's claims for Medicaid reimbursement for HCBS provided under the NHTD waiver program during calendar years 2014 through 2016 (audit period) for 79,166 beneficiary-months totaling nearly $215 million (Federal share).  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 100 beneficiary-months., During 33 of 100 sampled beneficiary-months, New York improperly claimed Medicaid reimbursement for some NHTD waiver program services.  Specifically, during 31 beneficiary-months, service notes for NHTD waiver program services did not support units billed and, during 2 beneficiary-months, services were performed by individuals whose qualifications were not documented.  Although one-third of sampled beneficiary months contained an error, we believe the magnitude of the errors and the financial impact are minimal.  As a result, New York was generally compliant with the Federal and State requirements.  New York officials stated that the claims for unallowable services occurred, in part, because of high staff turnover or inadequate training at the service providers. , On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York improperly claimed at least $466,614 in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for services that did not comply with certain Federal and State requirements., Additionally, we found instances in which New York's NHTD Waiver Program Manual, made available to providers on its website, did not reflect current requirements., We recommend that New York 1) refund $466,614 to the Federal Government, 2) update its NHTD Waiver Program Manual to reflect current waiver requirements, and 3) ensure providers properly train personnel to appropriately claim Medicaid reimbursement for NHTD waiver program services. , In written comments on our draft report, the State agency did not indicate concurrence or non-concurrence with our first recommendation, generally agreed with our second and third recommendations, and described corrective actions it had taken or planned to take to address the recommendations.  Regarding our recommended financial disallowance, New York stated that it is performing audits in the NHTD waiver program area.

During State fiscal years (SFYs) 2010 through 2014, hospitals received a total of $5.1 billion in LIP funds.  Jackson Memorial Hospital (the Hospital) received $1.8 billion of this total., The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) performed reviews of the LIP program covering SFYs 2007 through 2009 and found that Florida did not provide adequate oversight and guidance.  As a result, the hospitals claimed unallowable costs and inconsistently documented, calculated, and reported costs.  Florida also had not refunded $146.1 million of Federal funds related to hospital-reported LIP overpayments disallowed by CMS., Our objective was to determine whether Florida made LIP payments to the Hospital in accordance with the waiver and applicable Federal regulations. , 
Our audit covered SFYs 2010 through 2014, the most recent SFY for which supporting calculations were available.  We reviewed the cost-limit calculations and supporting LIP data for unallowable items and clerical errors, and we recalculated the Hospital's cost limits for caring for low-income patients. , Florida paid hundreds of millions to the Hospital under the LIP program that were not in accordance with the waiver and applicable Federal regulations.  Of the $1.8 billion in LIP payments made to the Hospital during our audit period, Florida claimed Medicaid reimbursement of $686 million ($412 million Federal share) in excess of the Hospital's allowable costs, including $132 million ($64 million Federal share) of net Hospital-reported overpayments and $554 million ($348 million Federal share) of unallowable costs identified during this audit., We recommend that Florida (1) refund $412 million to the Federal Government, including $64 million of hospital-reported net overpayments and $348 million of unallowable costs identified during this audit; (2) instruct hospitals to establish procedures to return the Federal share of any overpayments in their LIP cost-limit calculations; (3) establish procedures to ensure that it returns to the Federal Government the Federal share of overpayments reported by hospitals; and (4) improve its oversight of the LIP program.  We also made other procedural recommendations., The Hospital disagreed with most of our findings.  Most significantly, the Hospital contended that we incorrectly determined that it should offset Medicare and commercial insurance payments against costs for dual-eligible patients.  After reviewing the Hospital's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are correct, with one exception related to nonmedical assistance costs. , Florida disagreed with our findings.  Like the Hospital, Florida argued that we incorrectly determined that the Hospital should offset Medicare and commercial insurance payments against costs for dual-eligible patients.  Florida also argued that we did not properly consider the intersection of the LIP and disproportionate share hospital programs, contending that we should not have offset DSH payments that it had identified as overpayments.  Florida also said that we should reduce Medicaid payments by the overpayment that it identified in its preliminary analysis of Medicaid rate settlements.  After reviewing Florida's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are correct but reduced the recommended refund from $436 million to $412 million based on additional information that Florida provided. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

These expenditures represented approximately 5.9 percent of the total Medicaid expenditures reported on the Form CMS-64 during this period.  We decided to perform this audit of the CIH Waiver services because of the significant dollar expenditures. , Our objective was to determine whether Indiana ensured that CIH Waiver services at 12 selected providers were provided in accordance with Federal, State, and waiver requirements., Our audit covered 487,576 CIH Waiver service claims from 12 selected CIH service providers, totaling approximately $467.4 million, that had service dates during FFYs 2015 and 2016., We randomly selected and reviewed 300 of the 12 service providers' CIH Waiver service claims, with payments totaling $864,685, to determine whether Indiana ensured that the CIH Waiver services were provided in accordance with Federal, State, and waiver requirements. , We selected the 300 CIH Waiver service claims using a stratified random sample., Indiana did not ensure that all CIH Waiver services were provided in accordance with Federal, State, and waiver requirements.  We determined that services associated with 236 claims were provided in accordance with the requirements; however, services associated with 64 claims were not.  Documentation provided by CIH Waiver service providers did not support that services associated with 39 claims were provided in accordance with the requirements.  Overpayments associated with these 39 claims totaled $10,675 ($7,108 Federal share).  In addition, some CIH Waiver service providers were unable to provide any documentation to support 25 claims totaling $90,802 ($60,448 Federal share).  Therefore, overpayments associated with the 64 claims totaled $101,477 ($67,556 Federal share).  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that these providers were unable to support that they provided services totaling at least $33.5 million ($22.3 million Federal share) in accordance with the CIH Waiver requirements. , These issues occurred because Indiana's monitoring of CIH Waiver services was not adequate to ensure that services complied with Federal, State, and CIH Waiver requirements., We recommend that Indiana: (1) refund $22.3 million to the Federal Government and (2) improve its monitoring of the CIH Waiver program to ensure that service providers comply with Federal, State, and CIH Waiver requirements., In written comments on our draft report, the State agency generally did not concur with our findings and recommendations.  Indiana provided a variety of legal, statistical, and other reasons for not concurring with our recommendation to refund $22.3 million to the Federal Government.  Indiana did not concur with our second recommendation and stated that it actively monitors its providers for compliance with Federal, State, and CIH waiver requirements and already has a robust system in place, which it is continuously improving upon.

Prior OIG audit reports have consistently identified NEMT services as vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse., Our objective was to determine whether Michigan's NEMT brokerage program claimed Medicaid reimbursement for NEMT services provided by its contracted provider, LogistiCare, in accordance with Federal and State requirements., We reviewed Michigan's oversight of its NEMT brokerage program, including its monitoring of LogistiCare's compliance with Federal and State requirements for verifying that (1) beneficiaries received a Medicaid-eligible service performed on the NEMT date of service, (2) transportation provider qualifications met State regulations, (3) vehicles complied with State regulations, (4) there was adequate documentation supporting all provisions of the NEMT program, and (5) NEMT transportation providers retained all appropriate records.  We reviewed 200 randomly sampled claims from LogistiCare's 682,819 transports between October 2012 and September 2014 for which LogistiCare was paid $24.9 million., Of the 200 claims in our sample, 105 did not comply with Federal and State requirements.  Specifically, Michigan's oversight and monitoring of LogistiCare did not ensure that NEMT services were adequately documented; driver qualifications were met; vehicle inspection, safety, and insurance requirements were met; and NEMT records were maintained.  , On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that at least 243,508 Medicaid claims, totaling $4.5 million (Federal share), did not comply with Federal and State regulations.  Because the items we reviewed related to LogistiCare's assurances on the safety of the vehicles used to transport Medicaid patients and the qualifications of the individuals who drove those vehicles, LogistiCare's failure to provide full supporting documentation for those items posed a potential risk to the health and safety of the Medicaid beneficiaries who used the services of Michigan's Medicaid transportation brokerage program., We recommend that Michigan refund $4.5 million to the Federal Government, improve its oversight and monitoring of its NEMT brokerage program by requiring LogistiCare to strengthen its procedures, and  controls over its process for reporting expenditures claimed for NEMT services.  Also, Michigan should ensure that the State agency's contract with the transportation broker contains provisions that provide a means for the State agency to recoup, through future capitation rates, funds from the transportation broker when contract provisions and State requirements are not met. , In written comments on our draft report, Michigan acknowledged that additional improvements are necessary in regards to its oversight and monitoring of its NEMT broker and that it is in the process of working with the NEMT broker to implement corrective actions.  Regarding our recommendation to refund $4.5 million, Michigan said that a lack of some supporting documentation does not mean that the services provided were not appropriate and, therefore, does not agree that the entire amount should be refunded. , We maintain that our findings are valid. The contract specifies that both the services and the quality and safety of the services must have supporting documentation.  Therefore, the lack of supporting documentation we found in our review were violations of the terms of the contract and render all the undocumented services unacceptable for payment., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
57,A-07-16-03209,Nebraska Did Not Always Comply With Federal and State Requirements for Claims Submitted for the Nonemergency Transportation Program Audit (A-07-16-03209) 03-01-2017,"The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (State agency) claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for some nonemergency medical transportation (NET) services claims submitted by NET providers that did not comply with Federal and State requirements during fiscal years (FYs) 2012 through 2014.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that the State agency improperly claimed at least $1.9 million (Federal share) in unallowable Medicaid reimbursement for NET services during this period.  In addition, NET providers did not have documentation to support that State-mandated driver background checks, vehicle maintenance checks, and driver qualification verifications had been performed., These errors occurred because the State agency's policies and procedures did not ensure that NET providers complied with Federal and State requirements for documenting and claiming NET services.  Additionally, the State agency's policies and procedures did not ensure that NET providers maintained documentation to support that driver and vehicle checks were performed in accordance with State requirements., We recommended that the State agency (1) refund to the Federal Government $1.9 million (Federal share) in estimated overpayments for NET claims that were in error and did not comply with Federal and State requirements; and (2) strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that transportation services are provided only to recipients who are receiving Medicaid-covered services on the dates that they are receiving NET services; NET providers maintain records documenting that recipients are actually transported in the vehicles for all trips on the dates that NET services are rendered; NET providers maintain records to document the services provided; it does not pay NET providers or claim Federal reimbursement for non-covered transportation services; NET providers complete the required background checks on all potential drivers before permitting them to render NET services and annually thereafter, and maintain documentation of these checks; NET providers maintain records of all vehicle maintenance checks; and NET providers maintain documentation verifying that their drivers are qualified with current and valid driver's licenses., In written comments on our draft report, the State agency disagreed with most of our findings and provided additional documentation regarding some of the errors that we had identified in our draft report.  The State agency described corrective actions that it had taken or planned to take but disagreed with our estimate of the improperly claimed costs.  After reviewing the State agency's comments and the additional documentation, we revised some of our findings, our statistical estimate, and the dollar amount conveyed in our first recommendation.

58,A-02-16-01022,New York May Not Have Complied With Federal and State Requirements Prohibiting Medicaid Payments for Inpatient Hospital Services Related to Provider-Preventable Conditions Audit (A-02-16-01022) 12-19-2018,"Provider-preventable conditions (PPCs) are certain reasonably preventable conditions caused by medical accidents or errors in a health care setting.  Federal regulations effective July 1, 2011, prohibit Medicaid payments for services related to PPCs.  The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) delayed its enforcement of the regulations until July 1, 2012, to allow States time to develop and implement new payment policies.  This review is one in a series of OIG reviews of States' Medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services related to PPCs.

                , Our objective was to determine whether New York complied with Federal and State requirements prohibiting Medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services related to treating certain PPCs.  , We reviewed Medicaid paid claim data for July 2013 through June 2016 (audit period) to identify claims that contained at least one secondary diagnosis code for a PPC and those missing a present-on-admission (POA) code or with a POA indicating that the condition was either not present on admission or the documentation in the medical record was insufficient to make a determination.
<h3>What OIG Found</h3>
We were unable to determine whether New York complied with Federal and State requirements prohibiting Medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services related to treating certain PPCs because New York did not provide sufficient evidencethat it properly identified claims containing PPCs or determined whether the payments for the related services should have been reduced.  Without such evidence, we could not verify whether New Yorkâs payments for claims containing PPCs were appropriately reduced.
We identified claims totaling $90.9 million ($50.3 million Federal share) that contained a diagnosis code identified as a PPC and certain POA codes, or the claims were missing POA codes.  According to New York, based on its own limitedreview of a subset of claims we identified, its claim processing system ensured that payments for all claims with PPCs were processed accurately.  However, New York did not provide sufficient evidence that it prevented or reduced any payments.  Therefore,we could not independently verify whether claims were processed correctly.  In addition, we requested documentation of the list of PPCs New York said were programmed into its claim payment processing system used to identify PPCs, as well as its policies andprocedures to identify and update PPCs.  However, New York did not provide the requested documentation.  Therefore, we have set aside payments for these services for resolution by CMS and New York.
<h3>What OIG Recommends and New York's Comments</h3>
We made a series of recommendations to New York, including that it provide CMS with sufficient documentation to determine whether any portion of the $50.3 million Federal Medicaid reimbursement was unallowable and refund to the FederalGovernment the unallowable amount.
In written comments on our draft report, New York generally agreed with our recommendations; however, it disagreed with our finding.  Although New York asserts that it is appropriately reducing payments in accordance with Federal andState requirements, we maintain that, without sufficient evidence to support its assertion, we cannot objectively determine whether it complied with requirements prohibiting Medicaid payments for inpatient hospital services related to treating certain PPCs. Therefore, we maintain that our finding and related recommendations are valid.

The State agency did not follow the provision of its Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)-approved State plan directing it to perform a retrospective clinical review of the claims with diagnosis codes identified as PPCs.  In addition, the State agency paid inpatient hospital claims in which the present-on-admission (POA) indicator data field had been left blank.  We identified inpatient hospital claims totaling $2.7 million ($1.7 million Federal share) that contained a diagnosis code identified as a PPC and (1) a POA code indicating that the condition was not present on admission, (2) a POA code indicating that the documentation in the patients medical record was insufficient to determine whether the condition was present on admission, or (3) no POA code.  Therefore, we are setting aside this amount for resolution by CMS and the State agency., Furthermore, when developing and implementing its system edits, the State agency incorrectly excluded some diagnosis codes that were subject to the payment reduction.  In addition, the State agency incorrectly included other diagnosis codes that should not have been subject to the payment reduction. , The State agencys noncompliance with Federal requirements occurred because the State agency did not have adequate policies and procedures to review certain claims to determine whether payments should have been adjusted.

We estimated that the State agency did not obtain the nursing homes' evidence verifying correction of deficiencies in accordance with Federal requirements for 52 percent of the deficiencies identified during surveys in CY 2014.  We also estimated that the State agency could not provide sufficient evidence that corrective actions had been taken for 13 percent of the deficiencies identified during those surveys.  In addition, the State agency did not always conduct required standard surveys within 15 months of the previous standard surveys in CY 2014 in accordance with Federal requirements.  , We recommended that the State agency (1) improve its practices for verifying nursing homes' correction of identified deficiencies, (2) update controls and policies and procedures to ensure that survey system data is protected against unauthorized or unintended modification or loss, and (3) develop and implement a correction plan to ensure that the interval between consecutive standard surveys does not exceed 15 months.

70,A-07-17-03224,Nebraska Did Not Always Verify Correction of Deficiencies Identified During Surveys of Nursing Homes Participating in Medicare and Medicaid ,"Nebraska did not always verify nursing homes correction of deficiencies identified during surveys in calendar year (CY) 2016 in accordance with Federal requirements.  We estimated that Nebraska did not obtain or maintain the nursing homes evidence verifying correction of deficiencies for 866 (92 percent) of the 938 deficiencies identified during surveys in CY 2016. , Nebraskas practice, in cases of less serious deficiencies that did not require followup surveys, was to accept the nursing homes plans of correction without requiring any additional documentation.  For more serious deficiencies that did require followup surveys, Nebraska did not maintain sufficient documentation to show that it had verified the correction of these deficiencies.  (Federal requirements specify that State agencies obtain evidence of correction or conduct followup surveys to verify that nursing homes are in substantial compliance with Federal participation requirements.)  Evidence of correction that may have been on record for more serious deficiencies was stored in electronic files that could not be opened or were missing., We recommended that Nebraska revise its policies to require nursing homes to include evidence of correction with all submitted correction plans for deficiencies at or above the level of seriousness designated in Federal requirements and ensure that this evidence is retained by the State.  We also recommended that Nebraska maintain accessibility of, and the ability to read, survey data documentation in accordance with changes in technology.  , Nebraska described corrective actions that it said it had implemented.  Nebraska asserted that for less serious deficiencies, acceptance of a nursing homes plan of correction constituted acceptable evidence of correction; Nebraska also pointed to an operational dysfunction in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) electronic system.  Regarding the more serious deficiencies, Nebraska disputed that both it and we were unable to open the electronic files containing evidence of correction.  Nebraska said that its staff accessed CMSs secure software and provided the information to us. , We maintain that our findings and recommendations remain valid.  A nursing homes submission of a plan of correction does not relieve a State of its responsibility to verify that previously identified deficiencies have been corrected.  In addition, the evidence of correction that Nebraska provided was limited and, contrary to the States own procedures, came from only one information source.p., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

The State agency did not fulfill many of the participant safeguard assurances it provided to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services in its Medicaid waiver.  Specifically, the State agency did not (1) ensure that community-based providers reported all critical incidents to the State agency; (2) ensure that community-based providers conducted administrative reviews of all critical incidents involving serious injuries, dangerous situations, or suicidal acts and submitted their findings within 30 days; (3) report appropriately all restraint usage and rights violations to Disability Rights Maine (DRM); (4) review and analyze data on all critical incidents; (5) investigate and report immediately to the appropriate district attorney's office or to law enforcement all critical incidents involving suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation; and (6) ensure that community-based providers reported all beneficiary deaths to the State agency appropriately and that the State agency analyzed, investigated, and reported the deaths to law enforcement or Maine's Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME)., The State agency failed to demonstrate that it has a system to ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the 2,640 Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities covered by the Medicaid waiver.  , We recommended that the State agency fully implement its own regulations regarding the reporting and monitoring of critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community residences.  Specifically, we recommended that the State agency (1) work with community-based providers on how to identify and report all critical incidents; (2) work with community-based providers to ensure that administrative reviews are conducted and reported appropriately; (3) report appropriately all restraint usage and rights violations to DRM; (4) perform trend analysis and analytical procedures, such as a data match, to provide community-based providers with reports that identify patterns and trends to prevent reoccurrences of critical incidents and determine the number and percentage of critical incidents reported in required timeframes; (5) investigate and immediately report to the appropriate district attorney's office or law enforcement all critical incidents involving suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation; (6) ensure community-based providers report to the State agency all beneficiary deaths and that the State agency analyzes, investigates, and reports these deaths to law enforcement or OCME; and (7) provide training to the State agency's and community-based providers' staffs regarding the home and community-based services waiver and State requirements for critical incident reporting., In written comments on our draft report, the State agency agreed or partially agreed with all seven of our recommendations and with four of our findings, but it did not agree with two of our findings.  Specifically, the State agency disagreed that it did not ensure that community-based providers reported all critical incidents and that it did not investigate or report critical incidents to the appropriate authorities.  We maintain that the evidence supports all our findings."
72,A-03-16-00202,"Although Hospital Tax Programs in Seven States Complied With Hold-Harmless Requirements, the Tax Burden on Hospitals Was Significantly Mitigated Audit (A-03-16-00202) 11-08-2018","Since 2003, the United States Government Accountability Office has identified Medicaid as a high-risk program. Between Federal fiscal years (FYs) 2011 and 2017, Medicaid expenditures rose 42 percent from $430 billion to $610 billion. By FY
                2025, Medicaid is projected to have annual expenditures of $958 billion. The Social Security Act requires States to provide at least 40 percent of the non-Federal share of Medicaid expenditures, while up to 60 percent may be derived by
                local sources, including health-care-related taxes, as long as the taxpayer is not held harmless for the tax payment. However, this cost sharing requirement only applies to the aggregate of annual Medicaid program expenditures, not on
                a service-specific basis., Our objectives were (1) to determine if hospital tax programs in seven States were in compliance with hold-harmless requirements and (2) to assess the financial impact of these programs on the States, the Federal Government, and the hospitals
                in the tax programs we reviewed. , We reviewed the hospital tax programs of seven States with the largest health-care-related tax programs: California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. For each State, we reviewed hospital tax program documentation
                to determine compliance with hold-harmless requirements, the level of taxes collected, and the financial impact on the State, Federal Government, and hospitals., The health-care-related hospital tax programs in the seven States we reviewed complied with hold-harmless requirements. The seven States in our review collected $38.4 billion in tax revenue from their hospitals during State FYs 2011 through
                2015. The $38.4 billion was used as the State share of Medicaid payments and resulted in a draw-down of $54.6 billion in Federal matching funds for a total of $93 billion. From the $93 billion, $60.2 billion was used for supplemental payments
                for non-disproportionate share hospitals (non-DSHs) to mitigate most of the hospital tax payments and $32.7 billion was used mostly for additional hospital services., In the States reviewed, we found that non-DSH supplemental payments exceeded 75 percent of hospital tax payments in each year for all States, except for 2 years in Pennsylvania and 1 year for Ohio. However, since the tax rate was less than
                the 6 percent safe-harbor threshold, the tax programs could return more than 75 percent of the tax payments to more than 75 percent of the taxpayers without violating the hold-harmless requirement (75/75 requirement). Had the tax rates
                exceeded 6 percent, CMS could have deemed those hospital tax programs as impermissible, which would disqualify the use of the tax revenue for drawing down Federal matching funds. , We recommend that CMS re-evaluate the effects of the health-care-related tax safe-harbor threshold and the associated 75/75 requirement to determine if modifications are needed, such as the reduction or elimination of the safe harbor threshold
                or adjusting the 75/75 requirement, and take appropriate action. CMS concurred with our recommendation and stated that it will evaluate the effects of the health-care-related-tax threshold and the associated 75/75 requirement to determine
                if modifications are needed., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

In New Jersey, a prior OIG audit found that a contingency fee contractor made incorrect or unsupported changes to random moment timestudies used to calculate payment rates for Medicaid school-based health services.  Because the contractor used similar timestudies to calculate Medicaid school-based administrative costs, we initiated this audit. , The objective of our audit was to determine whether New Jersey's use of random moment sampling in claiming Medicaid school-based administrative costs met Federal requirements., Our audit covered $63.8 million in Federal Medicaid school-based administrative costs claimed by New Jersey for the period October 2011 through June 2016.  Specifically, we reviewed New Jersey's random moment sampling methodology and a statistical sample that included 227 activity moments., The random moment sampling methodology used by New Jersey to claim Medicaid school-based administrative costs did not meet Federal requirements.  Specifically, it did not comply with statistical sampling requirements and was not adequately supported.  Also, the methodology did not comply with New Jersey's approved cost allocation plan.  In addition, New Jersey's coding of what school employees were doing during random moments was mostly incorrect or unsupported.  , The random moment sampling methodology used by New Jersey did not comply with Federal requirements because New Jersey disregarded CMS guidance and assurances it made to CMS.  Therefore, we determined that New Jersey claimed $63.8 million in unallowable Federal Medicaid reimbursement. , We recommend that New Jersey refund $63.8 million in Federal Medicaid payments and revise its random moment sampling methodology to comply with Federal requirements, its implementation plan, CMS guidance, and assurances it made to CMS. , In written comments on our draft report, New Jersey did not concur with our findings and described steps it has taken to modify its data system.  New Jersey asserted that it has worked in good faith with CMS to develop a revised random moment sampling methodology to claim school-based Medicaid costs in compliance with Federal requirements.  It also submitted a memorandum from its contractor providing a detailed explanation of how New Jersey operated under the proposed implementation plan while waiting for CMS to approve that plan.  New Jersey also informed us that CMS approved its implementation plan., After reviewing New Jersey's comments and the contractor's memorandum, 
we reclassified two sampled activity moments that did not affect our recommended disallowance and clarified one sub-recommendation based on CMS's approval of the implementation plan.  We maintain that our findings and recommendations, as revised, are valid.  The approved implementation plan was effective October 1, 2016, which was after the end of our audit period. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
74,A-07-18-04107,Vulnerabilities Exist in State Agencies' Use of Random Moment Sampling To Allocate Costs for Medicaid School-Based Administrative and Health Services Expenditures,"Inadequate oversight at both the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the State Medicaid agency (State agency) level created vulnerabilities in State agencies' use of random moment timestudies (RMTS) as a basis to allocate and claim Federal Medicaid reimbursement for costs associated with school-based administrative activities and health services.  Previous OIG reviews of 10 State agencies that used RMTS to allocate costs for school district administrative claiming (SDAC) and school-based health services (SBHS) determined that the State agencies claimed a total of $435.4 million in SDAC and SBHS costs that were not in accordance with Federal requirements and guidance.  , Of the 10 State agencies, 5 claimed unallowable SDAC and SBHS costs, 3 claimed SDAC costs without having properly submitted cost allocation plans that described their RMTS methodologies, and all 10 did not correctly develop the RMTS methodologies used to allocate costs.  Furthermore, some of the annual cost settlements performed by three State agencies did not take all interim payments into account.  In addition, three State agencies could not provide medical record documentation to support the responses provided by RMTS participants; therefore, we could not determine whether services for which the State agencies had claimed SBHS costs had actually been performed.  Finally, we could not determine which portions of an additional $325.1 million of SDAC and SBHS costs were allowable in two States whose RMTS methodologies used sample universes that were or may have been inaccurate., We made procedural recommendations to CMS for instructions to all State agencies regarding their SDAC and SBHS programs and their RMTS methodologies.  We also recommended that CMS distribute formal guidance for the use of RMTS to allocate SBHS costs or consider no longer permitting States to use RMTS methodologies to allocate and claim SBHS costs., CMS concurred with both of our recommendations and described corrective actions that it said it would take, to include issuing updated guidance to State agencies regarding (1) policies and procedures to monitor SDAC and SBHS programs and (2) the requirement to maintain and retain adequate medical record documentation to validate RMTS responses and support SBHS costs claimed., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
75,A-04-17-00113,Kentucky Claimed Millions in Unallowable School-Based Medicaid Administrative Costs A-04-17-00113 06-24-2021,"In prior audits of school-based administrative and health services costs that States allocated to Medicaid using random moment sampling (RMS), we identified significant overpayments.  After conducting a risk assessment of Kentucky's Medicaid Administrative Claiming program, we determined that Kentucky claimed significant Medicaid school-based administrative costs based on its RMS.  We conducted this audit because of the significant amount claimed and our prior findings related to costs that States allocated to Medicaid using RMS.  , Our objective was to determine whether Kentucky claimed school-based Medicaid administrative costs in accordance with Federal requirements., Our audit covered $58.9 million ($29.4 million Federal financial participation (FFP)) in school-based administrative costs allocated to Medicaid using RMS and claimed on Kentucky's Medicaid expenditure reports for Federal fiscal years (FFYs) 2009 through 2014 (audit period).  We reviewed Kentucky's RMS procedures, including random moment time study methodologies and documentation of the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Cost Allocation (DCA) approvals of related cost allocation plan (CAP) amendments., Kentucky did not claim school-based Medicaid administrative costs in accordance with Federal requirements.  It used an invalid RMS to allocate costs to Medicaid, and it included unallowable costs in its cost pools.  In addition, Kentucky claimed these costs without promptly submitting CAP amendments to DCA for review and without obtaining DCA approval.  As a result, the $58.9 million ($29.4 million FFP) that it claimed in school-based Medicaid administrative costs for FFYs 2009 through 2014 was unallowable., We recommend that Kentucky: (1) refund $29.4 million to the Federal Government; (2) amend its CAP to address the statistical validity issues we identified; (3) enhance RMS procedures to ensure that its RMTS methodology complies with Federal requirements for statistical validity; (4) enhance RMS procedures to ensure that its Medicaid administrative cost claim complies with Federal requirements for allocable costs; (5) enhance policies and procedures to ensure that changes to its RMTS methodology are incorporated into a CAP amendment and promptly submitted to DCA for review; and (6) review school-based Medicaid administrative costs claimed after our audit period and refund any unallowable amounts., In written comments on our draft report, Kentucky generally disagreed with our findings, and it did not specifically address our recommendations.  It agreed with certain elements of our findings and described actions it had taken or could take to address them.  However, Kentucky did not agree with our findings that its RMS was invalid, that support staff costs included in its cost pools were unallowable, or that its CAP amendments were not promptly submitted for approval. , Kentucky did not provide any additional documentation with its comments, and nothing in Kentucky's comments warranted changing our findings and recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

77,A-07-17-02807,Colorado Improperly Claimed Millions in Enhanced Federal Medicaid Reimbursement for New Adult Group Beneficiaries Because of a Data Processing Error A-07-17-02807 10-02-2020,"In 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The ACA established enhanced Federal reimbursement rates for services provided to nondisabled, low-income adults without dependent children (new adult group).  The enhanced reimbursement rates established under the ACA have raised concerns about the possibility that States could improperly enroll individuals for Medicaid coverage in the new adult group and, as a consequence, the potential for improper payments., Our objective was to determine whether Colorado properly claimed reimbursement for Medicaid services provided from January 1, 2014, through September 30, 2015, to beneficiaries who were enrolled in the new adult group but who later became ineligible for Medicaid coverage., Our audit covered almost 580,000 newly eligible beneficiaries for whom Colorado received $2.2 billion in enhanced Federal reimbursement during our audit period.  To identify terminated beneficiaries, we matched Medicaid claim data from Colorado's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) to eligibility span data that showed the timespan(s) for which each beneficiary was eligible; no eligibility spans would exist for the timespans in which a beneficiary was not eligible for Medicaid. , Colorado claimed reimbursement for Medicaid services provided from January 1, 2014, through September 30, 2015, to some beneficiaries who were enrolled in the new adult group but who later became ineligible for Medicaid coverage.  As a result, Colorado improperly claimed and received over $1.9 million in Federal reimbursement for these beneficiaries past the termination dates of their Medicaid eligibility., Colorado properly terminated 1,543 beneficiaries' eligibility in the Colorado Benefits Management System (CBMS), which determines Medicaid eligibility and interfaces with other automated systems, but erroneously kept them as eligible in the MMIS.  The beneficiaries' eligibility was not terminated in the MMIS because of a data processing error in which eligibility data from the CBMS did not always transfer correctly to the MMIS through the normal automated process.  Although the CBMS interfaced with the MMIS, for some beneficiaries a change in eligibility determination from eligible to ineligible that occurred in the CBMS did not transfer correctly to the MMIS.  , We recommend that Colorado (1) refund to the Federal Government the over $1.9 million in improperly claimed Medicaid reimbursement, (2) identify and refund to the Federal Government any payments made on behalf of ineligible beneficiaries for whom services after our audit period were claimed and reimbursed past the termination dates of their eligibility, and (3) establish adequate system controls that ensure that eligibility determinations transfer correctly from the CBMS to the MMIS to prevent payments from being made on behalf of ineligible beneficiaries. , Colorado disagreed with our first two recommendations and agreed with our third recommendation.  For all three recommendations, Colorado said that it did not need to take additional action because the issues affecting eligibility determinations and the resulting claims payments had already been identified and addressed before our audit.  We maintain that all of our findings and recommendations remain valid.  We disagree that Colorado had already identified and addressed the errors we describe in this report.  The errors we identified were data processing errors in Colorado's systems, not eligibility errors., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
78,OEI-09-14-00020,Challenges Appear to Limit States' Use of Medicaid Payment Suspensions Report  (OEI-09-14-00020) 09-05-2017,"State Medicaid agencies (Medicaid agencies) are required to suspend payments for health care items and services when there is a credible allegation of fraud against the provider, unless ""good cause"" exists not to suspend payment.  Using payment suspensions, when appropriate, is important to protect Medicaid funds: payment suspensions based on credible allegations of fraud can swiftly stop the flow of Medicaid dollars to providers defrauding Medicaid.  A payment suspension can remain in place throughout the law enforcement investigation and potential prosecution of the health care fraud case., We collected self-reported individual case data for credible allegations of fraud, payment suspensions, and good cause exceptions during Federal fiscal year (FY) 2014 from Medicaid agencies.  We also surveyed both Medicaid agencies and Medicaid Fraud Control Units regarding challenges and benefits of payment suspensions that are based on a credible allegation of fraud., Most Medicaid agencies (41 of 56) reported imposing 10 or fewer payment suspensions during 
FY 2014.  Medicaid agencies reported significant challenges associated with imposing payment suspensions.  These include (1) demonstrating sufficient evidence to support payment suspensions when providers appealed, (2) not jeopardizing law enforcement investigations when providers appealed, and (3) sustaining payment suspensions through lengthy fraud investigations without unintentionally driving innocent providers out of business.  Medicaid agencies often applied ""good cause exceptions,"" during which payment suspensions are not suspended, while law enforcement investigated a credible allegation of fraud against a provider.  Additionally, Medicaid agencies reported taking actions that improved their processes for payment suspensions, including how they handle fraud allegations and collaborate with law enforcement., We recommend that the Centers for Medicaid &amp; Medicare Services (CMS) provide additional technical assistance to help Medicaid agencies fully utilize Medicaid payment suspensions as a program integrity tool.  CMS concurred with our recommendation."

Prior OIG reviews have identified vulnerabilities in States' information systems and controls-vulnerabilities that could have resulted in unauthorized disclosure of protected health information (PHI).  States must be prepared to respond to breaches to limit potential harm, such as identity theft and fraudulent billing.  , We collected information about all breaches that Medicaid agencies and their contractors reported experiencing in 2016.  We also surveyed 50 States and the District of Columbia to learn more about their processes for responding to breaches of PHI.  Lastly, we interviewed and reviewed documents from officials in nine States to learn more about how each State responded to a specific breach that we selected and about their breach-response processes more generally.  For each of these nine breaches, we examined how the State learned about the incident; how it determined whether the incident constituted a breach under HIPAA, how the State and others investigated the breach; and what actions the State took to protect its beneficiaries and programs and to correct vulnerabilities., Most of the 1,260 breaches that State Medicaid agencies and their contractors identified in 2016 disclosed information about a single individual and often resulted from misdirected letters or faxes; large breaches from hacking were rare.  Most States' breach-response plans follow a common framework: (1) learning about incidents; (2) assessing incidents and determining how to respond; (3) taking steps to protect those affected; and (4) correcting vulnerabilities.  However, the specific actions that States take vary depending on the circumstances of each breach and on any applicable State laws and requirements.  These State actions address the potential harm that breaches can pose to Medicaid beneficiaries and programs.  States' breach-response processes also address the requirements under the Breach Notification Rule-part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-for States to notify affected individuals and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights.  In 2006, CMS issued guidance advising States to inform CMS of breaches of Medicaid data.  Some States shared that they report breaches to CMS in certain circumstances; however, most States said that they do not routinely do so. , We recommend that CMS reissue guidance to States about reporting Medicaid breaches to CMS.  Collecting information on a national scale regarding Medicaid data breaches could help CMS identify breach trends and promote effective State responses.  CMS concurred with our recommendation."

Of the 100 beneficiary matches in our sample, Georgia correctly claimed reimbursement for capitation payments on behalf
                of 28. However, Georgia incorrectly claimed multiple capitation payments that totaled $201,561 ($132,765 Federal share) on behalf of the remaining 72. Of the 72 beneficiary matches that had multiple capitation payments within our audit
                period, 48 had additional payments that were outside of our audit period and totaled $192,101 ($126,488 Federal share). The improper payments made on behalf of these beneficiaries occurred because Georgia used several systems to input
                and assign Medicaid ID numbers to beneficiaries but did not properly identify when beneficiaries had multiple Medicaid ID numbers. On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Georgia made unallowable capitation payments between

Using computer matching and other data analysis techniques, we determined that Medicaid payments to the same MCO were at risk for similar noncompliance with Medicaid requirements., Our objective was to determine whether New York claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for managed care payments made to the same MCO on behalf of beneficiaries who were assigned more than one Medicaid ID number., Our audit covered Medicaid managed care payments totaling $25.5 million (Federal share) for 13,784 beneficiary-matches that New York made to the same MCO for the same month during the period January 2015 through September 2019.  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 105 of these beneficiary-matches.  We defined a beneficiary-match to be when (1) more than one Medicaid ID number was associated with the same Social Security number (SSN) or (2) no SSN was provided but select personal information (i.e., first four characters of the first name, entire last name, date of birth, and gender) was identical for more than one Medicaid ID number., New York improperly claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for Medicaid beneficiaries who were assigned more than one Medicaid ID number.  Specifically, for 100 of the 105 beneficiary-matches in our sample, New York made managed care payments to the same MCO for the same beneficiary for the same month under different Medicaid ID numbers., The assignment of more than one Medicaid ID number and resulting improper payments occurred because (1) New York's procedures for identifying whether an individual applying for Medicaid had already been assigned a Medicaid ID number were not always followed, (2) system queries were not adequate to ensure that all individuals with existing Medicaid ID numbers were identified, and (3) local district and Marketplace staff did not use all available resources to ensure that qualified applicants were not issued  more than one Medicaid ID number.  We note that, in 2019 and 2020, New York took steps to improve its processes for identifying beneficiaries assigned more than one Medicaid ID number., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York claimed at least $10.6 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for managed care payments made to the same MCO on behalf of beneficiaries assigned more than one Medicaid ID number.  We reduced our recommended financial disallowance to reflect payments New York refunded after our fieldwork., We made a series of recommendations to New York, including that it refund $9,325,338 to the Federal Government and identify and recover improper managed care payments made to the same MCO on behalf of beneficiaries with more than one Medicaid ID number prior to and after our audit period., New York did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations; however, it described steps that it has taken or plans to take to address them.  New York also stated that it refunded more than $1 million for payments made on behalf of beneficiaries assigned more than one Medicaid ID number.  We verified that New York refunded more than $1 million in recoveries after completion of our fieldwork for payments in our sampling frame and revised our report accordingly., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
84,A-04-20-07094,Kentucky Made Almost $2 Million in Unallowable Capitation Payments for Beneficiaries With Multiple Medicaid ID Numbers A-04-20-07094 12-02-2021,"Previous Office of Inspector General audits identified Federal Medicaid reimbursement for managed care payments that were not claimed in compliance with Federal requirements.  Specifically, some beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care had more than one Medicaid identification (ID) number.  As a result, Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) received unallowable monthly Medicaid payments for these beneficiaries., Our objective was to determine whether the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services (Kentucky) made unallowable capitation payments on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple Medicaid ID numbers., Our audit covered approximately $6.97 million ($4.94 million Federal share) in Medicaid capitation payments Kentucky made to MCOs from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2019, for the 1,634 beneficiary matches that we identified.  We selected and reviewed a stratified random sample of 100 of these beneficiary matches., Kentucky made unallowable capitation payments on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple Medicaid ID numbers.  Of the 100 beneficiary matches in our sample, Kentucky correctly made capitation payments on behalf of 3.  However, it incorrectly made capitation payments that totaled $455,296 ($323,126 Federal share) on behalf of the remaining 97.  , The unallowable capitation payments occurred because the beneficiaries had multiple Medicaid ID numbers.  According to Kentucky, the beneficiaries had multiple ID numbers because either the beneficiaries themselves or the caseworkers entered demographic data incorrectly during the application process.  , On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Kentucky made unallowable capitation payments totaling at approximately $2.7 million ($1.9 million Federal share) on behalf of beneficiaries with multiple Medicaid ID numbers during our audit period., We recommend that Kentucky: (1) refund to the Federal Government approximately $1.9 million (Federal share) in unallowable payments, (2) review capitation payments that fell outside of our audit period and refund any unallowable payments, and (3) enhance or establish new controls to ensure that no beneficiary is issued multiple Medicaid ID numbers., In written comments on our draft report, Kentucky agreed with our findings but disagreed with refunding the extrapolated amount.  It said that it was conducting its own audit of the entire population of payments made during our audit period.  In addition, Kentucky described the corrective actions that it plans to take to address our recommendations., After reviewing Kentucky's comments, we maintain that it should refund the extrapolated amount of approximately $1.9 million (Federal share)., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

93,OEI-05-15-00050,T-MSIS Data Not Yet Available for Overseeing Medicaid Report  (OEI-05-15-00050) 06-26-2017,"In 2016, the Federal Government and States spent $574 billion on Medicaid, serving more than 74 million enrolled individuals.  Complete, accurate, and timely Medicaid data are vital for the effective administration and oversight of the Medicaid program by States and the Federal Government.  Historically, problems with Medicaid data have hindered program integrity, research, budgeting, and policy.  Consequently, OIG has designated the improvement of Medicaid data as a top management challenge facing the Department of Health and Human Services.  The Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) is a new data system intended to improve the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of Medicaid data.  , This review provides a status update on the implementation of T-MSIS, building on OIG's 2013 review of the T-MSIS pilot., We analyzed the implementation status of T-MSIS as of December 2016 using 40 States' approved plans for data submission.  In addition, we interviewed staff from CMS and 16 States about their experiences implementing T-MSIS.  , States and CMS report that early implementation challenges have resulted in delays with T-MSIS.  These delays were caused by technological problems during data testing and by competing priorities for States' IT resources.  As a result, the goal for when T-MSIS will contain data from all State Medicaid programs has been repeatedly postponed.  Most recently, CMS indicated that it expects that all States will be reporting to T-MSIS by the end of 2017.  As of December 2016, 21 of 53 State programs were submitting data to T-MSIS.  As States and CMS continue to work together to submit data into T-MSIS, they continue to raise concerns about the completeness and reliability of the data; OIG raised these same concerns in our 2013 review of the T-MSIS pilot.  Specifically, States indicate that they are unable to report data for all the T-MSIS data elements.  Additionally, even with a revised data dictionary that provides definitions for each data element, States and CMS report concerns about States' varying interpretations of data elements.  If States do not have uniform interpretations of data elements, the data they submit for these elements will not be consistent across States, making any analysis of national trends or patterns inherently unreliable., Successfully getting all States' data into T-MSIS requires States and CMS to prioritize T-MSIS implementation.  Because of CMS's history of delaying target dates for implementation, OIG is concerned that CMS and States will delay further rather than assign the resources needed to address the outstanding challenges.  Thus, OIG continues to support our 2013 recommendation that CMS establish a deadline for when T-MSIS data will be available for program analysis and other management functions.  Without a fixed deadline, some States and CMS may not make the full implementation of T-MSIS a management priority."
94,A-06-18-09001,New Mexico Did Not Always Appropriately Refund the Federal Share of Recoveries from Managed Care Organizations Audit (A-06-18-09001) 02-12-2019,"Of the $374 million in managed care organization (MCO) recoveries, New Mexico appropriately refunded the Federal share for $359 million.  However, New Mexico underreported the Federal share for the remaining $15 million by $4.4 million because (1) it incorrectly calculated the Federal share of recoveries related to Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion population payments, which the Federal Government originally matched at 100 percent using the regular Federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), and (2) it did not consider higher FMAPs, such as for Family Planning and Breast and Cervical Cancer, in its Federal share calculations for MCO recoveries of other beneficiary populations' payments., Additionally, New Mexico did not perform reconciliations of capitation payments for community-based long-term care services as required under its contracts with MCOs.  As a result, New Mexico had not made any MCO recoveries related to those long-term care services. , We recommended that New Mexico refund to the Federal Government the additional $4.4 million Federal share related to ACA expansion MCO recoveries and MCO recoveries originally claimed at higher FMAPs, such as those for Family Planning and Breast and Cervical Cancer.
We also recommended that New Mexico establish policies and procedures to identify MCO recoveries that were originally claimed at higher FMAPs, perform reconciliations in accordance with its contracts with MCOs, and consider conducting its reconciliations in a more timely manner. , In written comments on our draft report, New Mexico partially concurred with our recommendations.  Regarding our first and third recommendations, New Mexico agreed to work with CMS to refund the additional $4.4 million to the Federal Government and to develop an appropriate allocation methodology for MCO recovery reporting.  As for our second recommendation, New Mexico stated that it is already following a timeline established under the MCO contracts. , New Mexico disagreed with our final recommendation and responded that it had conducted an analysis of long-term services and supports capitation payments that met the requirements of the reconciliation.

To identify our population of deceased beneficiaries, we matched Indiana's Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) data with the Social Security Administration's Death Master File using the beneficiaries' Social Security numbers, names, and dates of birth.  We then identified all capitation payments that occurred at least 1 month after the beneficiaries' month of death. , We selected a stratified random sample of 100 capitation payments totaling $85,657 ($62,911
Federal share) to confirm that the beneficiaries were deceased and that payments made on behalf of the deceased beneficiaries were recovered., Indiana made capitation payments on behalf of deceased beneficiaries.  We confirmed that 70 of the 71 beneficiaries associated with the 100 capitation payments in our stratified random sample were deceased.  Of the 100 capitation payments, Indiana made 95 unallowable payments totaling $79,403 ($58,773 Federal share).  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Indiana made payments totaling at least $1.1 million ($862,097 Federal share) to MCOs on behalf of deceased beneficiaries during our audit period., Indiana did not always fully process Medicaid beneficiaries' death information in the MMIS.  Although the State agency's eligibility systems interfaced with Federal and State data exchanges that identify dates of death, the State agency did not enter the dates of death in the MMIS for 48 of our sampled beneficiaries.  Additionally, the State agency did not recover the capitation payments for 22 sampled beneficiaries that did have a date of death in the MMIS., We recommend that Indiana (1) refund $862,097 to the Federal Government; (2) identify and recover unallowable payments made to MCOs during our audit period on behalf of deceased beneficiaries, which we estimate to be at least $1.1 million; (3) identify capitation payments made on behalf of deceased beneficiaries before and after our audit period, and repay the Federal share of amounts recovered; and (4) ensure that dates of death are added to the MMIS and that capitation payments made after the beneficiaries' deaths are recovered., In written comments on our draft report, Indiana concurred with all of our recommendations.  Indiana said that it will recover the capitation payments identified in the audit and return the Federal share, recover capitation payments that were made for deceased beneficiaries during and outside of the audit period, and ensure that dates of death are added to the MMIS. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

In addition, New York adjusted 12 capitation payments before our audit.  For the remaining 84 payments, New York made unallowable payments totaling $269,473 ($143,643 Federal share). , The unallowable payments occurred because New York did not: (1) have system edits to identify errors in the automated process that terminates beneficiaries' eligibility after dates of death were identified; (2) update the eligibility and payment systems with correct dates of death; (3) identify as deceased and disenroll beneficiaries that had a date of death in one of its death data sources; or (4) use additional sources of death information and alternative procedures similar to those that we used in our audit to identify, verify, or determine dates of death., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York made payments to MCOs on behalf of deceased beneficiaries totaling at least $23.3 million ($13.7 million Federal share) during our audit period., We recommend that New York: (1) refund the $13.7 million to the Federal Government and (2) identify and recover unallowable payments made to MCOs during our audit period on behalf of deceased beneficiaries, which we estimate to be at least $23.3 million.  We also made other procedural and administrative recommendations., New York did not specifically indicate that it concurred with our findings and recommendations.

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) and others have ongoing concerns about program integrity in Medicaid managed care., We based this study on data from three sources: (1) a survey requesting 2015 data from the MCO with the largest expenditures in each of the 38 States that provides Medicaid services through managed care, (2) structured interviews with officials from five selected MCOs, and (3) structured interviews with officials from the same five States as the selected MCOs., Managed care organizations (MCOs) play an increasingly important role in fighting fraud and abuse in Medicaid, yet weaknesses exist in their efforts to identify and address fraud and abuse.  Although the number of cases varied widely, some MCOs identified and referred few cases of suspected fraud or abuse to the State in 2015, and not all MCOs used proactive data analysis-a critical tool for fraud identification., At the same time, selected States employ a number of strategies to address MCOs' weaknesses and improve their efforts.  These include providing education and training and facilitating information sharing among MCOs.  States also reported using encounter data to conduct their own proactive data analysis, but these data have limitations. , We recommend that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) work with States to (1) improve MCO identification and referral of cases of suspected fraud or abuse, (2) increase MCO reporting to the State of corrective actions taken against providers suspected of fraud or abuse, (3) clarify the information MCOs are required to report regarding providers that are terminated or otherwise leave the MCO network, (4) identify and share best practices about payment-retention policies and incentives to increase recoveries, (5) improve coordination between MCOs and other State program integrity entities, (6) standardize reporting of referrals across all MCOs in the State, (7) ensure that MCOs provide complete, accurate, and timely encounter data, and (8) monitor encounter data and impose penalties on States for submitting inaccurate or incomplete encounter data.  CMS concurred with all but one of our recommendations; it did not concur with our recommendation to work with States to standardize the reporting of referrals in the State."

102,A-05-17-00013,The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Had Not Recovered More Than a Billion Dollars in Medicaid Overpayments Identified by OIG Audits,"In a previous review, OIG determined that CMS had recovered the majority of Medicaid overpayments that we had identified in audit reports issued during Federal fiscal years (FYs) 2000 through 2009.  However, millions of dollars remained uncollected at the time we issued our report.  We performed the current audit as a followup to the previous audit to determine whether CMS recovered Medicaid overpayments for a more recent period, as well as remaining overpayments in the previous audit.  Our objective was to determine whether CMS recovered overpayments identified in OIG audit reports in accordance with Federal requirements. , We reviewed CMS's efforts to collect overpayments identified in 313 audits issued in FYs 2010 through 2015 (the current period) that recommended recovering overpayment amounts totaling $2.7 billion and 10 audits issued for FYs 2004 through 2009 (the prior period) that recommended recovering overpayment amounts totaling $225.6 million.  For these 323 audits, we chose only the overpayments that we had recommended for recovery and with which CMS had concurred, which totaled $2.6 billion for the current period and $191.3 million from the prior period., CMS had not recovered all of the overpayments identified in OIG audit reports in accordance with Federal requirements.  Specifically, CMS did not collect $1.6 billion in overpayments identified in 77 current period audits and $188.6 million in overpayments identified in 7 prior period audits.  CMS is in discussions with State officials regarding 26 reports and 51 outstanding overpayments that continue to be in the disallowance process.  In addition, CMS did not ensure that States correctly reported Medicaid overpayments on the Quarterly Medicaid Statement of Expenditures for the Medical Assistance Program Form CMS-64 (CMS-64).  Finally, we could not verify the accuracy of $2.7 million that CMS told us was reported by States because before our review CMS disposed of documents supporting that overpayments were recovered., CMS had not recovered all overpayments covered by this review because its policies and procedures did not include timelines for resolving overpayments when State agencies disagreed with the recommendations.  CMS did not ensure that States correctly reported Medicaid overpayments because it did not always verify that States followed its guidance.  CMS did not retain documentation to support that overpayments were recovered because its standard operating procedures included a retention period that was inconsistent with Federal retention guidelines.  , CMS's prompt recovery of overpayments helps ensure that Federal funds are effectively and efficiently used to carry out the activities for which they are authorized.  CMS's failure to collect and States' failure to pay illustrates a significant financial stewardship vulnerability., We recommend that CMS recover the remaining $1.6 billion due the Federal Government from the current period and $188.6 million due the Federal Government from the prior period and improve the timeliness of recovering overpayments by setting guidelines about the time CMS has to work with States to obtain documentation and issue disallowance letters to States.  We also recommend that CMS verify that States report overpayments correctly, require States to resubmit corrected CMS-64s when they do not, and continue to educate States about their responsibility to report overpayments correctly.  In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions that it has taken or plans to take to address the recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Specifically, CMS resolved 1,231 of the 1,371 recommendations that were outstanding during FYs 2015 and 2016.  However, it did not resolve 405 of the 1,231 recommendations (32.9 percent) within the required 6-month resolution period.  In addition, as of September 30, 2016, CMS had not resolved 140 audit recommendations that were past due for resolution.  Some of the past-due recommendations had associated dollar amounts that totaled $138.6 million; others were procedural in nature., CMS had policies and procedures in place to ensure that audit recommendations were resolved in compliance with Federal requirements.  Although CMS did not always issue management decisions and submit the related clearance documents within the required 6-month resolution period, CMS did make progress in this respect (compared with the findings of our previous review) by significantly increasing the percentage of audit recommendations that were resolved in a timely manner and by significantly reducing both the total number and associated dollar amounts of unresolved audit recommendations that were past due for resolution., Without resolving all audit recommendations in a timely manner, CMS runs the risk of noncompliance with Federal requirements and mismanagement of Federal funds.  The prompt resolution of audit recommendations helps ensure that Federal funds are effectively and efficiently used to carry out the activities for which they were authorized., We recommended that CMS continue to follow its policies and procedures related to the audit resolution process, and enhance them where possible, and promptly resolve the 140 outstanding audit recommendations that were past due as of September 30, 2016., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described corrective actions that it had taken or planned to take.  CMS stated that it would continue to assess and further refine its audit resolution process to ensure that recommendations are resolved within the required period.  CMS also stated that it had already resolved 97 of the 140 open recommendations (with associated dollar amounts that totaled $109 million) and added that it expected to resolve the remaining 43 recommendations by early 2019., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Specifically, we could not determine if the hospitals met performance goals calculated from Medicaid claims data.  In addition, the hospitals did not report patients' health records information consistent with performance measure criteria.  As a result, we could not determine what portion of pay-for-performance incentive payments, totaling approximately $51 million ($25 million Federal share), that New Jersey made to the five selected hospitals based on determinations from New Jersey's Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program contractor was appropriate.  , This occurred because New Jersey did not ensure that the DSRIP program contractor maintained Medicaid claims data to support the achievement of performance goals and did not provide adequate guidance to the hospitals regarding how they should report patients' health records information., We recommended that New Jersey work with its DSRIP manager and program contractor and the five selected hospitals to determine whether the approximately $51 million ($25 million Federal share) in pay-for-performance incentive payments to the hospitals was appropriate.  New Jersey should also work with its DSRIP manager and program contractor and the 44 hospitals not selected for review to determine whether the approximately $132 million ($66 million Federal share) in remaining pay-for-performance incentive payments was appropriate.  We also recommended that New Jersey improve its oversight of the DSRIP program to ensure compliance with Medicaid requirements.  , In written comments on our draft report, New Jersey disagreed with our findings and did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations.  However, it described steps that it has taken to improve its oversight of the DSRIP program.

These incentive payments have significantly increased funding to providers for their efforts related to the quality of services.  Texas made DSRIP Program payments totaling almost $10 billion for 5 years. , Our objective was to determine whether Texas used permissible funds as the State share of DSRIP Program payments., Our audit covered $189.3 million in funds used as the State share of $445.9 million in total DSRIP Program payments made to three providers for December 12, 2011, through September 30, 2016.  We traced the flow of DSRIP-related transactions to financial records, compared contracts that an intergovernmental transfer (IGT) entity managed to the same contracts assumed by one of the providers, and calculated the Federal share that Texas received because of impermissible provider-related donations., Of the $189.3 million in funds that Texas used as the State share of DSRIP Program payments, $146.6 million was funded through impermissible provider-related donations that did not meet Federal requirements.  Those funds were derived from impermissible provider-related donations because:, Texas did not decrease its Medicaid expenditures by the $146.6 million as required under Federal requirements.  As a result, Texas inappropriately received $83.8 million in Federal funds., We recommend that Texas (1) refund the $83.8 million it inappropriately received because it used IGTs derived from impermissible provider-related donations as the State share of DSRIP Program payments; (2) provide its IGT entities with guidance about arrangements that may result in impermissible provider-related donations, such as those outlined in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) clarifying letter; and (3) request that its IGT entities disclose whether similar arrangements exist and provide Texas with action plans on ending the arrangements., Texas concurred with our third recommendation to the extent that it contemplates identifying arrangements that resemble those outlined in a Departmental Appeals Board decision and provided information on actions it had taken related to that recommendation.  Texas did not concur with our first and second recommendations because of the reliance we placed on CMS and judicial determinations, which are currently under appeal by Texas.  After review and consideration of Texas' comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid because Texas' impermissible provider-related donations were in violation of Federal regulations that applied during the audit period.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
109,A-01-17-00004,Rhode Island Did Not Ensure Its Managed Care Organizations Complied With Requirements Prohibiting Medicaid Payments for Services Related to Provider-Preventable Conditions Audit (A-01-17-00004) 01-04-2019,"Rhode Island did not ensure its Medicaid managed-care organizations (MCOs) complied with Federal and State requirements prohibiting Medicaid payments to providers for inpatient hospital services related to treating certain provider-preventable conditions (PPCs).  PPCs are certain reasonably preventable conditions caused by medical accidents or errors in a health care setting.  For our audit period, we identified that MCOs paid providers approximately $4 million for 241 claims that contained PPCs.  Rhode Island's internal controls were not adequate to ensure that its MCOs complied with Federal and State requirements.  For instance, Rhode Island did not follow up with the MCOs to determine why present on admission codes were missing or whether the payments made for the related claims complied with Federal and State requirements.  In addition, the MCOs did not have policies or procedures to identify PPCs on claims for inpatient hospital services or determine whether payments for claims containing PPCs should have been reduced.  As a result, the unallowable portion of the $4 million identified for our audit period was included in the capitation payment rates for State fiscal years 2017 and 2018. , We made several recommendations to Rhode Island, including (1) work with the MCOs to determine the portion of the $4 million that was unallowable for claims containing PPCs and its impact on current and future capitation payment rates; (2) include a clause in its managed-care contracts with the MCOs that would allow the State agency to recoup funds from the MCOs when contract provisions and Federal and State requirements are not met, thereby resulting in potential cost savings; and (3) require the MCOs to implement internal controls to prohibit payments for inpatient hospital services related to treating PPCs, and other procedural recommendations., In written comments on our draft, Rhode Island concurred with four of our six recommendations and described the actions that it planned to take to address them.  Although the State agency did not concur with two of our recommendations, it did describe how it plans to take action related to them."
110,OEI-05-16-00510,Reliance on Unverified Patient Lists Creates a Vulnerability in Home Health Surveys Report  (OEI-05-16-00510) 03-05-2018,"Home health is a program area susceptible to fraud, waste, and abuse.  To ensure that home health agencies (HHAs) comply with Medicare standards, Medicare requires them to undergo onsite surveys conducted by State survey agencies or accrediting organizations prior to initial enrollment and at least once every 36 months thereafter.  As part of this process, however, surveyors use HHA supplied lists to select patients for review, prompting concern that HHAs could manipulate these lists to avoid scrutiny of certain patients., For selected high risk HHAs in three States, we collected HHA-supplied patient lists used by surveyors for recent surveys. We then compared these lists to Medicare claims data to identify any missing beneficiaries.  We also conducted interviews with State survey agencies, accrediting organizations, CMS regional offices, and the CMS central office regarding processes for conducting surveys of HHAs and surveyors' use of HHA supplied patient lists., We found that some HHA supplied patient lists in our review were missing Medicare beneficiaries, allowing them to be excluded from surveyor reviews.  We also found that surveyors cannot comprehensively verify that HHA supplied patient lists are complete at the time they conduct their surveys, creating a vulnerability that HHAs could exploit to conceal fraudulent activity or health and safety violations.  However, existing data sources may be useful tools for both surveyors and CMS. , Looking ahead, we encourage CMS to explore the costs and benefits of actions it could take to mitigate the risk that this vulnerability poses and better protect Medicare and its beneficiaries.  We have identified some potential strategies, including using existing data to provide better information for surveyors and conducting retrospective reviews."

                for HBO therapy that did not comply with Medicare requirements for 110 claims (92 percent), resulting in overpayments for HBO therapy totaling $351,970. We did not review the remaining five claims because one was canceled and the Recovery
                Audit Contractor indicated that the other four were under review by another entity. , First Coast made payments for HBO therapy that did not always comply with Medicare requirements because it had limited policies and procedures in place to ensure that it made correct payments. During the audit period, First Coast did not have
                effective automated Medicare Part A prepayment edits in its claims processing system to monitor HBO therapy coverage. Based on our sample results, we estimated that First Coast overpaid providers in Jurisdiction N $39.7 million during
                the audit period for HBO therapy that did not comply with Medicare requirements., We made the following recommendations to First Coast: (1) recover the portion of the $351,970 in Medicare overpayments; (2) notify the 70 providers responsible for the remaining 46,737 nonsampled claims with potential overpayments estimated
                at $39.3 million so that those providers can investigate and return any identified overpayments; (3) identify and recover any improper payments for HBO therapy services made after the audit period, and (4) work with the Centers for Medicare

113,A-07-16-04229,Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation Did Not Properly Settle Missouri Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments Audit (A-07-16-04229) 06-20-2017,"With respect to Medicaid patient days, Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation (WPS) did not properly settle for Federal fiscal years (FYs) 2010 through 2012 Medicare cost reports submitted by inpatient hospitals in Missouri (Missouri providers) for Medicare disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments in accordance with Federal requirements.  The 20 settled Medicare cost reports that Missouri providers submitted for FYs 2010 through 2012 reflected 612,517 Medicaid patient days.  The 10 selected providers (with those 20 associated cost reports) improperly claimed a total of 7,132 Medicaid patient days on their cost reports, resulting in DSH overpayments totaling $3.0 million.  These improper claims included both unallowable and unsupported Medicaid patient days and involved patients in the excluded categories of family planning and family planning-related services, the Children's Health Insurance Program, temporary prenatal care services, State-only programs, patients who did not meet the designated spenddown requirements to qualify for spenddown programs, and dual eligibility., These errors occurred because the selected providers did not properly claim Medicaid patient days in accordance with Federal requirements when they prepared and submitted their cost reports to WPS.  Providers did so because they were not sufficiently educated on the excluded categories that did not qualify for Medicare DSH payments.  , Had WPS communicated with State Medicaid agency officials annually to identify and obtain updated listings of Missouri Medicaid eligibility codes as well as other State-level guidance affecting programs and other categories of services that figure into Medicare DSH cost report payments, the errors we identified could have been prevented., We recommended that WPS recover the $3.0 million in Medicare DSH overpayments from the selected Missouri providers, reopen and revise settled cost reports (from Missouri providers) that we did not review, and refund overpayments to the Federal Government.  We also recommended that WPS communicate annually with the Missouri State Medicaid agency to obtain updated eligibility information and furnish education to providers regarding the categories that are not considered to be Medicaid programs for purposes of Medicare DSH payments., WPS concurred with our first recommendation but did not concur with our recommendation to reopen and revise settled cost reports (from Missouri providers) that we did not review.

In addition, the IPF PPS includes an outlier payment policy that makes an additional payment in cases with unusually high costs to limit financial losses to IPFs., For this audit, we focused on claims that resulted in outlier payments because the number of those claims increased by 28 percent from fiscal year (FY) 2014 to FY 2015, and total Medicare payments for those claims (including the outlier payment portion) increased from $450 million to $534 million (19 percent)., Our objective was to determine whether IPFs complied with Medicare coverage, payment, and participation requirements for services provided in FYs 2014 and 2015 that resulted in outlier payments., Our audit covered 36,120 inpatient claims with nearly $1 billion in total Medicare payments.  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 160 claims.  We obtained medical and billing records from IPFs in our sample.  Both OIG and a qualified medical review contractor reviewed the records.  In addition, we interviewed officials at the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), a Medicare administrative contractor, and a subset of the IPFs in our sample., For our 160 sampled claims, we found that CMS paid 25 claims that did not meet Medicare medical necessity requirements for some or all days of the stay.  Based on our sample results, we estimated that Medicare overpaid IPFs $93 million for FYs 2014 and 2015 for stays that were noncovered or partially noncovered and resulted in outlier payments.  However, if the patients had been treated in a different setting, Medicare might have covered those treatments.  In addition, 142 claims had missing or inadequate medical record elements, including physician certifications.  Of those 142 medical records, 12 did not clearly support that the IPF had protected the patient's right to make informed decisions regarding care.  We estimated that 87 percent of IPF claims for FYs 2014 and 2015 with outlier payments did not meet Medicare medical necessity or medical record requirements.  CMS oversight activities were not adequate to prevent or detect the IPFs' errors.  , Finally, we identified three additional areas of concern: (1) outlier payments may have been made for stays that were not unusually costly, (2) beneficiaries used lifetime reserve days to help pay for days when they no longer required inpatient hospitalization but for the unavailability of appropriate posthospitalization placements, and (3) CMS did not track patient falls or fall rates at IPFs., We made seven recommendations to CMS.  Although our audit covered only IPF inpatient claims that resulted in outlier payments, our recommendations are relevant to nonoutlier claims.  CMS concurred with our recommendations to (1) increase the number of postpayment reviews to provide more feedback to IPFs, (2) promulgate regulations on the patient's right to make informed decisions regarding care, (3) study the accuracy of the outlier payment methodology, and (4) consider tracking patient falls or fall rates., CMS did not concur with our recommendations to research whether the physician certification requirements are useful in preventing inappropriate payments and then take appropriate followup action.  Nor did CMS concur with our recommendation that, in the interim, CMS require certifications to be in a specific format to aid in auditing.  Finally, CMS did not concur with our recommendation to study the lifetime reserve day issue.

115,OEI-09-16-00410,Medicare Advantage Appeal Outcomes and Audit Findings Raise Concerns About Service and Payment Denials Report  (OEI-09-16-00410) 09-25-2018,"A central concern about the capitated payment model used in Medicare Advantage is the potential incentive for MAOs to inappropriately deny access to services and payment in an attempt to increase their profits.  An MAO that inappropriately denies authorization of services for beneficiaries, or payments to health care providers, may contribute to physical or financial harm and also misuses Medicare Program dollars that CMS paid for beneficiary healthcare.  Because Medicare Advantage covers so many beneficiaries (more than 20 million in 2018), even low rates of inappropriately denied services or payment can create significant problems for many Medicare beneficiaries and their providers., We collected data on denials, appeals, and appeal outcomes for 2014-16 at each level of the Medicare Advantage appeals process.  We calculated the volume and rate of appeals and overturned denials at each level.  To examine CMS oversight, we analyzed CMS's 2015 audit results and the resulting enforcement actions, including Star Ratings data from 2016 to 2018., When beneficiaries and providers appealed preauthorization and payment denials, Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) overturned 75 percent of their own denials during 
2014-16, overturning approximately 216,000 denials each year.  During the same period, independent reviewers at higher levels of the appeals process overturned additional denials in favor of beneficiaries and providers.  The high number of overturned denials raises concerns that some Medicare Advantage beneficiaries and providers were initially denied services and payments that should have been provided.  This is especially concerning because beneficiaries and providers rarely used the appeals process, which is designed to ensure access to care and payment.  During 2014-16, beneficiaries and providers appealed only 1 percent of denials to the first level of appeal., Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) audits highlight widespread and persistent MAO performance problems related to denials of care and payment.  For example, in 2015, CMS cited 56 percent of audited contracts for making inappropriate denials.  CMS also cited 45 percent of contracts for sending denial letters with incomplete or incorrect information, which may inhibit beneficiaries' and providers' ability to file a successful appeal.  In response to these audit findings, CMS took enforcement actions against MAOs, including issuing penalties and imposing sanctions.  Because CMS continues to see the same types of violations in its audits of different MAOs every year, however, more action is needed to address these critical issues., We recommend that CMS (1) enhance its oversight of MAO contracts including those with extremely high overturn rates and/or low appeal rates and take corrective action as appropriate; (2) address persistent problems related to inappropriate denials and insufficient denial letters in Medicare Advantage; and (3) provide beneficiaries with clear, easily accessible information about serious violations by MAOs.  CMS concurred with all three recommendations."

In July 2013, the program was expanded to include a National Mail-Order Program for diabetes testing supplies.  The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) prohibits CMS from awarding a contract to a supplier of diabetes test strips if the supplier's bid does not cover at least 50 percent, by volume, of all types of diabetes test strips on the market.  (This is known as the ""MIPPA 50 percent rule."")  MIPPA requires OIG to determine the market shares of the types of diabetes test strips before each round of competitive bidding., On July 1, 2016, CMS began accepting claims for the current round of the National Mail-Order Program, which ends on December 31, 2018.  This is the third of three OIG reports to determine the Medicare market shares of diabetes test strips for the periods April through June 2016, July through September 2016, and October through December 2016, respectively.  CMS will use the results from the second OIG report (OEI-04-16-00471, February 2017) to determine bidders' adherence with the MIPPA 50-percent rule for the next round of competitive bidding.  The first and third reports provide CMS with additional information on the market shares of diabetes test strips supplied through the National Mail-Order Program., We determined the Medicare market shares for diabetes test strip types associated with a simple random sample of Medicare claims for the 3-month period of October 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016 (i.e., the second 3 month period after the July 1, 2016, start of the current round of the National Mail-Order Program).  Our sample of 1,210 claims was drawn from a population of 438,872 claims for mail-order diabetes test strips provided to beneficiaries.  To estimate the Medicare market shares, we surveyed suppliers and projected our sample data to the population of diabetes test strips provided by mail-order during the timeframe we reviewed., From October through December 2016, sampled suppliers provided 19 types of diabetes test strips via the Medicare National Mail-Order program.  The top 2 strip types accounted for 53 percent of the Medicare mail-order market, and the top 10 strip types accounted for 97.5 percent. "
117,OEI-06-16-00380,CMS Did Not Detect Some Inappropriate Claims for Durable Medical Equipment in Nursing Facilities 06-26-2018 Report (OEI-06-16-00380),"The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 directs OIG to monitor the appropriateness of Medicare payments for items and services-including durable medical equipment (DME)-provided during stays not covered by Medicare, called ""noncovered stays,"" in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs).  CMS requires facilities to provide DME as a standard part of nursing care, and does not permit separate Medicare payment for DME except when Medicaid only nursing facilities serve as beneficiary homes.  Previously, OIG found that CMS allowed $41.2 million in Medicare payments for inappropriate claims for DME provided during noncovered stays in SNFs ($30 million) and in Medicaid only nursing facilities ($11.2 million) in 2006.  In response to OIG's work, CMS implemented a new payment edit (automated payment process) to reject claims for DME provided during noncovered SNF stays.  However, CMS did not address stays in Medicaid-only nursing facilities.  This study provides an update to OIG's prior study, assessing Medicare claims for DME provided during noncovered stays in SNFs and Medicaid only nursing facilities., For 2015, we identified inappropriate claims for DME provided during noncovered stays in SNFs, and potentially inappropriate claims for DME provided during stays in Medicaid only nursing facilities.  We used admission and discharge dates from the Minimum Data Set and SNF claims to document facility stay dates and identify noncovered stays.  We then determined whether SNFs and DME suppliers submitted information required to facilitate proper billing for DME.  We also collected information about CMS's methods to prevent processing inappropriate claims for DME in these facilities., CMS's payment edits did not detect $18.4 million in Medicare payments in 2015 for inappropriate claims for DME provided during noncovered stays in SNFs.  This represented 6 percent of all payments for DME during noncovered stays in SNFs. , CMS uses two payment edits designed to identify and reject such claims, but neither edit rejected the claims because SNFs and DME suppliers did not submit full and accurate information required for processing., For 72 percent of the inappropriate DME claims, DME suppliers failed to correctly code the SNF as a facility.  Instead, they coded the place of service as the beneficiary's home, thus enabling the claims to bypass the CMS edit that rejects separate payment for most DME provided at facilities.  By definition, SNFs provide primarily skilled care and thus cannot be considered beneficiary homes.  For 98 percent of the inappropriate DME claims, SNFs did not submit ""no payment bills,"" which are administrative claims that document the dates of noncovered stays and do not result in payment.  No-payment bills enable another CMS edit to identify noncovered stays and reject claims for DME provided during those timeframes., CMS may have also allowed up to $3.7 million in Medicare payments for inappropriate claims for DME provided during stays in Medicaid only nursing facilities.  Unlike SNFs, these facilities can be considered beneficiary homes if they provide primarily nonskilled care, permitting separate Medicare payments for DME.  However, we found that CMS is unable to verify whether the facilities qualify as homes because CMS does not collect and maintain information regarding the level of care-i.e., skilled or nonskilled-that facilities provide., To improve detection of inappropriate DME claims, we recommend that CMS (1) strengthen oversight of place-of-service codes by developing a process to determine whether DME claims with ""home"" as the place of service fit the circumstances permitting separate payment; (2) assess the costs and benefits of strengthening oversight of no payment bills by developing a process to identify noncovered stays when SNFs do not submit no payment bills; and (3) assess the costs and benefits of collecting and maintaining information regarding the level of care provided by Medicaid only nursing facilities.  CMS concurred with our recommendations."
118,A-04-17-04056,Most Medicare Claims for Replacement Positive Airway Pressure Device Supplies Did Not Comply With Medicare Requirements Audit (A-04-17-04056) 06-07-2018,"Most Medicare claims that durable medical equipment suppliers submitted for replacement positive airway pressure (PAP) device supplies did not comply with Medicare requirements. Of the 110 claims in our sample that Medicare paid in 2014 and
                2015, 24 complied with Medicare requirements; however, 86 claims with payments totaling $13,414 did not. On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Medicare made overpayments of almost $631.3 million for replacement PAP device
                supply claims that did not meet Medicare requirements., These overpayments occurred because CMS oversight of replacement PAP device supplies was not sufficient to ensure that suppliers complied with Medicare requirements or to prevent payment of claims that did not meet those requirements. Without
                periodic reviews of claims for replacement supplies, Medicare contractors were unable to identify suppliers that consistently billed claims that did not meet Medicare requirements or to take remedial action., We recommended that CMS recover the portion of the overpayments of $13,414 associated with the 86 sample claims that are within the 4-year reopening period. We also made several recommendations for CMS to work more closely with the four Medicare
                contractors, which could have saved Medicare an estimated $631.3 million over a 2-year period., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendations and described the actions it planned to take to address them., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
119,OEI-12-16-00500,Medicaid Fraud Control Units:  Investigation and Prosecution of Fraud and Beneficiary Abuse in Medicaid Personal Care Services 12-06-2017,"OIG has conducted numerous audits, evaluations, and investigative work involving personal care services (PCS) and offered recommendations for improving program oversight.  Medicaid Fraud Control Units (MFCUs or Units) investigate and prosecute Medicaid provider fraud and patient abuse or neglect under State law.  We conducted this study to provide data on MFCU investigations, indictments, and convictions involving fraud and patient abuse in Medicaid PCS. , We administered to MFCUs a questionnaire regarding their PCS work for fiscal years (FYs) 2012 through 2015, and we performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results., During the review period, PCS fraud cases were a substantial and growing percentage of MFCU cases and outcomes.  In FY 2015, fraud cases involving PCS providers or attendants constituted 12 percent of total investigations.  From FY 2012 through FY 2015, fraud cases involving PCS providers or attendants constituted 38 percent of indictments and 34 percent of convictions.  During this time, indictments increased 56 percent and convictions increased 33 percent.  , MFCUs have made recommendations to States for strengthening PCS oversight, including that Medicaid agencies (1) enroll or register PCS attendants as Medicaid providers or assign each attendant a unique identifier; (2) require background checks for attendants; (3) institute additional documentation requirements; and (4) improve ongoing oversight of PCS providers and the services they deliver.  , Finally, in MFCUs' efforts to protect beneficiaries receiving PCS services, they are constrained by their ineligibility to receive Federal funding to investigate and prosecute complaints of beneficiary abuse or neglect in nonfacility settings (such as beneficiaries' homes).  , The volume and growth of MFCU investigations and prosecutions of PCS fraud suggest that PCS remain vulnerable to fraud and support the need for greater oversight of Medicaid PCS.  CMS has made efforts in this area, but MFCUs report that States have generally not implemented the specific recommendations that MFCUs made to them for strengthening program integrity , The recommendations that MFCUs made to States align with recommendations that OIG has made previously to CMS and which OIG continues to support.  In addition, to protect beneficiaries from abuse and neglect, it is key that Federal funding authority be expanded so that MFCUs can investigate and prosecute cases of patient abuse and neglect in nonfacility settings.  , <a href=""/oei/reports/oei-12-16-00500.xlsx"">Additional data can be found here</a>."
120,OEI-01-16-00330,A Few States Fell Short in Timely Investigation of the Most Serious Nursing Home Complaints: 2011-2015 Report  (OEI-01-16-00330) 09-28-2017,"<p style=""padding:7px 5px 2px 5px;""><a href=""/oei/maps/nursing-home/"">View related information</a>, The nursing home complaint process is a critical safeguard to protect vulnerable residents of nursing homes.  CMS relies on the States' respective survey agencies to serve as the front-line responders to address health and safety concerns raised by residents, their families, and nursing home staff.  State survey agencies must conduct onsite investigations within certain timeframes for the two most serious levels of complaints-those that allege serious injury or harm to a nursing home resident and require a rapid response to address the complaint and ensure residents' safety.  However, previous reports by OIG and the Government Accountability Office found that States did not conduct onsite investigations within the required timeframes for some of these complaints., OIG analyzed complaints regarding Medicare/Medicaid-certified nursing homes and associated investigation information entered into CMS's Automated Survey Processing Environment Complaints/Incidents Tracking System (ACTS) from 2011 through 2015.  We analyzed these data to determine: (1) the number of nursing home complaints that States received; (2) the percentage of complaints that States prioritized as immediate jeopardy and high priority (the two most serious levels of complaints); (3) the percentage of immediate jeopardy and high priority complaints that States investigated onsite within required timeframes; and (4) the percentage of immediate jeopardy and high priority complaints that States substantiated. , Overall, States received one-third more nursing home complaints in 2015 than in 2011.  Each year, half of all nursing home complaints were at the level of seriousness that requires a prompt onsite investigation, and the most common allegations among these related to quality of care or treatment.  During the period we reviewed, States conducted nearly all the required onsite investigations.  Although almost all States conducted most of their onsite investigations within required timeframes, a few States fell short.    Furthermore, almost one-quarter of States did not meet CMS's annual performance threshold for timely investigations of high priority complaints in all 5 years.  Lastly, States substantiated (i.e., verified with evidence) almost one third of the most serious nursing home complaints., This data brief raises questions about how some States respond to complaints, as these responses could have serious consequences for nursing home residents in those States.  It offers CMS some insights into the States that have room to improve in prioritizing and responding to nursing home complaints.  To ensure the health and safety of nursing home residents, CMS must remain vigilant and assist the States that are falling short in meeting timeframes for investigations of complaints.  OIG will continue to monitor the oversight of nursing homes and will initiate additional reviews as necessary."

It also mandated changes to Medicaid eligibility rules and established a higher Federal reimbursement rate for services provided to these beneficiaries, which led us to review whether States were correctly determining eligibility for these newly eligible beneficiaries.  California was one of 31 States, along with the District of Columbia, that chose to expand Medicaid coverage.  , We reviewed a stratified random sample of 150 newly eligible beneficiaries for whom Medicaid payments were made for services provided from October 2014 through March 2015.  We reviewed supporting documentation to determine whether California made payments on behalf of beneficiaries who did not meet Federal and State eligibility requirements for the newly eligible group or other coverage groups (e.g., income, citizenship, and pregnancy requirements)., For our sample of 150 beneficiaries, California made Medicaid payments on behalf of 112 eligible beneficiaries.  However, for the remaining 38 beneficiaries, California made payments on behalf of ineligible beneficiaries (e.g., a woman who did not meet eligibility requirements for the newly eligible group because she was pregnant) and potentially ineligible beneficiaries (e.g., a beneficiary who may not have met the residency requirement).  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that California made Medicaid payments of $738.2 million ($628.8 million Federal share) on behalf of 366,078 ineligible beneficiaries and $416.5 million ($402.4 million Federal share) on behalf of 79,055 potentially ineligible beneficiaries.  (These estimates represent Medicaid payments for fee-for-service claims, managed-care plans, the drug treatment program, and mental health services.)  These deficiencies occurred because California's eligibility determination systems lacked the necessary system functionality and eligibility caseworkers made errors.  We also identified a weakness in California's procedures related to determining eligibility of individuals who may not have intended to apply for Medicaid., We recommended that California (1) redetermine, if necessary, the current Medicaid eligibility of the sampled beneficiaries; (2) ensure its eligibility determination systems have the functionality to verify eligibility requirements and perform eligibility determinations in accordance with Federal and State requirements; and (3) develop and implement written policies and procedures, as appropriate., California disagreed with our specific recommendation related to beneficiaries who may not have met the residency requirement.  After reviewing information that California provided, we maintain that our recommendation is valid.  California should have sent the beneficiary in our sample the required residency confirmation letter or taken action to verify residency when California identified that the beneficiary may have been receiving public assistance in another State.  California agreed with our remaining recommendations and provided information on actions that it had taken or planned to take to address those recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

                an eligibility requirement, Kentucky did not perform or did not maintain documentation that it had performed identity-proofing for 13 beneficiaries in accordance with Federal requirements. The Federal identity-proofing requirements are
                intended to reduce the potential for identity theft., Kentucky did not always meet Federal and State requirements when making eligibility determinations because of human and system errors. As a result, we estimated that Kentucky made Federal Medicaid payments on behalf of 69,931 potentially ineligible
                beneficiaries totaling $72.8 million. We did not include the identity-proofing errors in our estimate of potentially ineligible beneficiaries and payments, but we are highlighting the potential for identity theft if the State agency does

After the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), some beneficiaries remained eligible under these traditional coverage groups.  We refer to these beneficiaries as ""non-newly eligible beneficiaries."" , This review is part of an ongoing series of OIG reviews of States' Medicaid eligibility determinations.  We conducted these reviews to address the concern that States might have difficulty accurately determining eligibility for Medicaid beneficiaries.  We selected New York to ensure that our reviews covered States in different parts of the country and because New York's pre-ACA eligibility guidelines were so broad, more than 90 percent of its post-ACA Medicaid beneficiaries are non-newly eligible., Our review covered 5,351,560 non-newly eligible beneficiaries for whom Medicaid payments totaling $24.6 billion ($13.2 billion Federal share) were made for services provided from October 2014 through March 2015.  We reviewed supporting documentation for a stratified random sample of 130 of these beneficiaries to evaluate whether New York determined the individuals' Medicaid eligibility in accordance with Federal and State eligibility requirements (e.g., income and citizenship requirements)., For our sample of 130 beneficiaries, New York correctly determined Medicaid eligibility for 110 beneficiaries but incorrectly determined Medicaid eligibility for 6 beneficiaries.  New York did not provide supporting documentation to verify that the remaining 14 beneficiaries were Medicaid-eligible.  For these beneficiaries, New York did not consider all available, relevant information or failed to comply with its Medicaid State plan or verification plan when determining Medicaid eligibility.  Additionally, New York's enrollment system did not always query all electronic data sources to ensure individuals were reporting all sources of countable income when applying for Medicaid.  Lastly, New York did not always maintain documentation to support eligibility determinations. , On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York made Federal Medicaid payments of $520.3 million on behalf of 383,893 ineligible beneficiaries and $1.3 billion on behalf of 618,057 potentially ineligible beneficiaries during our 6-month audit period., We recommended that New York (1) redetermine, as appropriate, the current Medicaid eligibility status of the sampled beneficiaries who did not meet Federal and State eligibility requirements; (2) take the necessary steps to ensure local district and marketplace staff consider all available, relevant information and data sources, as well as all Federal and State requirements when determining Medicaid eligibility, which could have reduced or eliminated an estimated $520.3 million in overpayments caused by eligibility errors over the 6-month audit period; and (3) maintain the necessary documentation to determine whether it enrolled individuals who did not meet Federal and State Medicaid eligibility requirements, which could have resulted in up to $1.3 billion in potentially improper Federal Medicaid payments over the 6-month audit period., New York did not specifically indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations.  However, it stated that it disagreed with our determinations for six sampled beneficiaries and provided, under separate cover, additional information related to these beneficiaries.  New York also described steps it has taken after our audit period to ensure that Medicaid determination and enrollment policies are adhered to.

If these beneficiaries' eligibility had been incorrectly determined, payments made on their behalf (1) would have been reimbursed at a higher rate than they should have been or (2) should not have been reimbursed at all.  This review is part of an ongoing series of reviews of newly eligible beneficiaries., Our objective was to determine whether Colorado made Medicaid payments on behalf of newly eligible beneficiaries who did not meet Federal and State eligibility requirements under the ACA. , We reviewed a simple random sample of 60 newly eligible beneficiaries who received Medicaid-covered services from January 2014 through September 2015 (audit period).  We reviewed supporting documentation to evaluate whether Colorado determined the applicants' eligibility in accordance with Federal and State requirements (e.g., income, citizenship or lawful presence, and other relevant requirements)., Colorado made Medicaid payments on behalf of newly eligible beneficiaries who did not meet, or who may not have met, Federal and State eligibility requirements.  Colorado correctly determined eligibility and, therefore, correctly claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement, on behalf of 43 of the 60 beneficiaries in our statistical sample.  However, of the remaining 17 beneficiaries whom Colorado determined to be newly eligible for Medicaid, 14 were ineligible and 4 may have been ineligible.  We estimated that the financial impact of the incorrect eligibility determinations made by Colorado totaled at least $66.5 million on behalf of 85,085 ineligible beneficiaries and at least $26.8 million on behalf of 13,372 potentially ineligible beneficiaries., These deficiencies occurred because Colorado did not always follow written policies and procedures when making eligibility determinations and because of system and procedural errors related to eligibility determinations, as well as human errors made by Colorado staff and caseworkers.  , We recommend that Colorado redetermine, as appropriate, the current Medicaid eligibility status of the sampled beneficiaries.  We also make other procedural recommendations regarding improvements to the design, functionality, and accuracy of Colorado's eligibility determination system.  , Colorado agreed with our recommendations and said that it had already implemented the necessary changes to correct the system and coding errors we identified.  Colorado said that our review was duplicative of other Federal and State reviews and added that because Colorado had identified and addressed the errors before our audit, it did not need to take additional action.  Colorado also said that our sample size was too small and questioned our statistical sampling and projection methodology. , We maintain that all of our findings and recommendations remain valid.  We disagree that Colorado had identified and addressed, before our audit, the system errors we describe in this report.  For many of the findings, we did not find evidence of corrective actions relevant to the findings, and Colorado did not identify or otherwise provide evidence that it had already taken corrective actions.

It also mandated changes to Medicaid eligibility rules.  These two factors led to a significant increase in applications for Medicaid coverage.  Prior OIG audits of New York, California, Colorado, and Kentucky found that these States did not always determine Medicaid eligibility for newly eligible beneficiaries and individuals eligible under traditional Medicaid coverage groups (referred to as non-newly eligible beneficiaries) in accordance with Federal and State requirements.  , The objective of this audit was to summarize the results of our prior audits in order to assist the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in achieving greater efficiencies in its operation of the Medicaid program., Our prior audits covered Federal Medicaid payments totaling $33.6 billion on behalf of almost 17.5 million beneficiaries.  Using statistical sampling, we reviewed the four States' Medicaid eligibility determinations., Our previous audits of 4 States' Medicaid eligibility determinations found that during 2014 and 2015 Medicaid payments were made on behalf of 109 of 460 sampled newly eligible beneficiaries and 98 of 515 sampled non-newly eligible beneficiaries who did not meet or may not have met Medicaid eligibility requirements.  We determined that both human and system errors, as well as a lack of policies and procedures, contributed to these improper or potentially improper payments.  Although the States concurred with all 31 recommendations from our prior audits to address these deficiencies, 15 of these recommendations remain unimplemented., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that the 4 States made Federal Medicaid payments on behalf of newly eligible beneficiaries totaling almost $1.4 billion for more than 700,000 ineligible or potentially ineligible beneficiaries.  We also estimated that the 4 States made Federal Medicaid payments on behalf of non-newly eligible totaling more than $5 billion for almost 5 million ineligible or potentially ineligible beneficiaries., We recommend that CMS: (1) work with States to implement all of the recommendations made in OIG's prior audits; (2) maintain its efforts to provide training, technical advice, and guidance to States to address the causes identified in OIG's prior audits; and (3) use all available remedies to prevent and reduce the amount of improper payments made on behalf of ineligible beneficiaries. , Although CMS stated that it will continue to work with States to implement OIG's prior recommendations, it requested that we remove the first recommendation.

Medicare does not have the authority to collect rebates for Part B drugs and biologicals (i.e., ""Part B drugs"").  In an earlier report, OIG found that a rebate program for Part B drugs could have resulted in at least $2.7 billion in rebates (both basic rebate and inflation-indexed rebate segments) in 2011.  OIG conducted this current review after receiving a congressional request asking us to update our earlier rebate calculations using only the inflation-indexed portion of the Medicaid rebate methodology., Applying the same formula that Medicaid uses to determine inflation-indexed rebates, we calculated how much in inflation-indexed rebates could have been associated 64 high-expenditure Part B drugs in 2015.  We performed separate calculations using both average sales prices (ASPs) and average manufacturer prices (AMPs).  We also identified claims issues and coding-related issues that would need to be addressed before implementing a rebate program under Part B., An ASP-based rebate program for Medicare Part B drugs could have resulted in $1.4 billion in inflation-indexed rebates in 2015 for 64 high expenditure drugs.  An AMP-based rebate program for the same 64 drugs could have resulted in $1.8 billion in inflation indexed rebates that same year.  Several implementation issues related to claims and data would need to be addressed should Congress decide to establish a rebate program under Part B., Inflation indexed rebates are intended to help protect State Medicaid programs and the Federal Government from significant drug price increases.  Medicare Part B does not have similar rebate authority.  The results of this current study build upon our original 2011 analysis.  This analysis did not take into account how implementation of a Part B rebate requirement could affect beneficiary coinsurance obligations, beneficiary access to prescription drugs, and the overall pharmaceutical marketplace.  Furthermore, we did not address the operational burden of implementing such a requirement., Any consideration of a rebate program should address the following administrative issues that may hinder rebate collections:  the use of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes, incorrect coding conversions, unavailable drug pricing data, and difficulties in identifying 340B purchased drugs."

Unlike predetermined payment amounts for most Medicare hospital claims, outlier payments are directly influenced by hospital charges.  We selected CHI St. Vincent Infirmary (St. Vincent) based on outpatient outlier payments increasing from $216,484 in 2013 to $1.4 million in 2014.  , Our objective was to determine whether outpatient outlier payments received by St. Vincent were based on properly billed claims., Our audit covered 593 outpatient outlier payments totaling $1,694,991 paid to St. Vincent for services rendered July 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016.  We selected a stratified random sample of 120 outlier payments totaling $622,742 for review.  Because outlier payments are based on total charges, we retrieved the claim detail related to each outlier payment.  We submitted the claims related to the 120 outlier payments to St. Vincent for them to review. We requested that St. Vincent verify that charges and codes on the claim were correct.  Additionally, OIG reviewed outlier claims data for inconsistences and claim support documentation for billing errors., St. Vincent properly billed 17 of the 120 sampled claims which had outliers totaling $41,606.  However, St. Vincent did not properly bill the remaining 103 sampled claims which resulted in improper outlier payments during our audit period.  These 103 claims, which had outliers totaling $581,136, contained 173 billing errors.  The billing errors primarily occurred because St. Vincent did not have adequate controls to prevent errors related to overcharged time, charge errors, and coding errors. , We recommend that St. Vincent amend the claims with errors to identify and return any improper outlier payments.  We also recommended that St. Vincent improve procedures and provide education to ensure claims billed to Medicare are accurate., In written comments to our draft report, St. Vincent did not explicitly agree or disagree with our recommendations; however, St. Vincent stated that it has already refunded the amounts specified in OIG's first three recommendations.  In addition, St. Vincent agreed with our first three findings regarding overcharged time, charge errors, and coding errors, and described corrective actions that it had taken or planned to take for each finding.  St. Vincent did not agree or disagree with our fourth finding regarding its procedures not ensuring compliance with Federal requirements.  Instead, St. Vincent stated that, based on OIG's findings, it has updated policies and procedures, revised systems, extended training to staff and implemented enhanced monitoring to promote billing compliance., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Such costs cannot be determined using only claim data because, although Medicare claim forms identify the medical procedures performed, they do not contain a field for reporting medical device-specific information.  The lack of information on the claim forms prevents the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) from being able to fully understand and address the Medicare costs related to recalled or prematurely failed medical devices.  In addition, the lack of information impedes the Food and Drug Administration and CMS's ability to identify poorly performing devices as early as possible.  This diminishes device recipients' chances of receiving timely followup care. , To examine the costs Medicare incurred because of recalled or prematurely failed medical devices, we reviewed the Medicare costs associated with seven cardiac devices from three manufacturers that had been recalled or had high failure rates over a 10-year period., We estimated the cost of Medicare services related to the replacement of seven recalled and prematurely failed cardiac devices totaled $1.5 billion over the 10-year period ending on December 31, 2014.  In addition, we estimated that beneficiaries had $140 million in copayment and deductible liabilities related to these replacements and their related services and procedures.  , 
To facilitate the use of claim data to identify and track the additional health care costs incurred by Medicare resulting from recalled or prematurely failed medical devices, we specifically recommend that CMS: (1) continue to work with the Accredited Standards Committee X12 to ensure that the Device Identifier is included on the next version of claim forms and (2) require hospitals to use condition codes 49 or 50 on claims for reporting a device replacement procedure if the procedure resulted from a recall or premature failure independent of whether there was a device provided at no cost or with a credit., In written comments on our draft report, CMS stated that our first recommendation is a policy that is under consideration.  CMS stated that it would carefully evaluate the potential that this policy would impose an unnecessary burden on physicians.  CMS stated that it concurred with our second recommendation ""in cases where payment is impacted.""  We continue to recommend that CMS require hospitals to use condition codes 49 or 50 on claims for reporting a device replacement procedure if the procedure resulted from a recall or premature failure regardless of whether there was a payment impact.

132,A-01-15-00503,Review of Tufts Medical Center Claims That Included Medical Device Replacements Audit (A-01-15-00503) 04-15-2016,"Tufts Medical Center (Tufts) (operating in Boston, Massachusetts) complied with Medicare billing requirements for 4 of the 18 inpatient and outpatient claims we reviewed.  However, Tufts did not fully comply with Medicare billing requirements for the remaining 14 claims, resulting in overpayments of at least $118,000 for calendar years 2011 through 2014.  These errors occurred primarily because Tufts staff (1) had inadequate education on inpatient level-of-care criteria and lacked documentation necessary to determine the appropriate level of service and (2) lacked the level of oversight and the coordination between departments to correctly report the device credits it received for warranted or recalled medical devices.

The hospitals' incorrect billing of these claims resulted in overpayments of $2.1 million that the hospitals had not identified, refunded, or adjusted by the beginning of our audit.  The Medicare contractors overpaid the hospitals because they had no specific controls to ensure that hospitals complied with Medicare requirements for reporting manufacturer credits., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
134,A-01-18-00502,Hospitals Did Not Comply With Medicare Requirements for Reporting Cardiac Device Credits A-01-18-00502 11-16-2020,"Prior OIG audits with audit periods ranging from 2005 through 2016 found that hospitals did not always comply with Medicare requirements for reporting credits received from manufacturers for medical devices that were replaced.  Specifically, hospitals did not always report to CMS device manufacturer credits that they received.  One prior review estimated that services related to the replacement of seven recalled and prematurely failed cardiac medical devices cost Medicare $1.5 billion during calendar years 2005 through 2014., Our objective was to determine whether hospitals complied with Medicare requirements for reporting manufacturer credits associated with recalled or prematurely failed cardiac devices., We obtained a list of warranty credits from the device manufacturers and matched the device recipients to the Medicare enrollment database to determine which recipients were Medicare beneficiaries.  Next, we matched the beneficiaries to the Medicare National Claims History to identify claims that had a cardiac device replacement procedure for which the date of service matched to the device replacement procedure date on the credit listing.  We evaluated compliance with selected billing requirements., For 3,233 of the 6,558 Medicare claims that we reviewed, hospitals likely did not comply with Medicare requirements associated with reporting manufacturer credits for recalled or prematurely failed cardiac medical devices.  Device manufacturers issued reportable credits to the hospitals for recalled or prematurely failed cardiac medical devices, but the hospitals did not adjust the claims with proper condition and value codes to reduce payments as required.  As a result, 911 hospitals received payments of $76 million rather than the $43 million they should have received, resulting in $33 million in potential overpayments.  Medicare contractors made these overpayments because they do not have a postpayment review process that would ensure that hospitals reported manufacturer credits for cardiac medical devices., We recommend that CMS: (1) instruct Medicare contractors to recover the portion of the $33 million in identified Medicare overpayments that are within the reopening period; (2) notify hospitals associated with potential overpayments outside the reopening period so that they can exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any  overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; (3) require hospitals to use condition codes 49 and 50 on claims; (4) instruct Medicare contractors to implement a postpayment review process; (5) obtain device credit listings from manufacturers and determine whether providers reported credits as required, (6) direct Medicare contractors to determine whether hospitals, which we have identified as having billed incorrectly in both this audit and our prior audit (A-05-16-00059), have engaged in a pattern of incorrect billing after our audit period and, if so, take appropriate action in accordance with CMS policies and procedures; and (7) consider eliminating the current Medicare requirements for reporting device credits by reducing the payments for cardiac device replacement procedures., CMS concurred with three of our seven recommendations and described the actions it planned to take to address them.  For the four recommendations that CMS did not concur with, we maintain that CMS should require the use of condition codes, implement a postpayment process, acquire the credit listings from manufacturers, and determine whether providers identified as having billed incorrectly continued to do so after the audit period., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
135,A-05-16-00059,Hospitals Did Not Comply With Medicare Requirements for Reporting Certain Cardiac Device Credits Audit (A-05-16-00059) 03-08-2018,"Prior OIG reviews found that hospitals did not always comply with Medicare requirements for reporting credits received from manufacturers for replaced medical devices.  , Recalls of medical devices can be quite costly to the Medicare program.  A recent OIG review estimated that services related to the replacement of seven recalled and prematurely failed medical devices cost Medicare $1.5 billion during calendar years 2005 through 2014.  , Our objective was to determine whether hospitals complied with Medicare requirements for reporting manufacturer credits associated with five recalled or prematurely failed cardiac medical devices., We obtained a list of warranty credits that two device manufacturers issued to hospitals for five cardiac medical devices that had been recalled or had high failure rates.  We reviewed the 296 claims that we considered at risk for overpayment because the hospitals billed for a device-intensive procedure, received a credit of 50 percent or greater, and did not include a value code or modifier on the claim as required. , Our audit covered $7.7 million in Medicare payments to hospitals for 153 inpatient and 143 outpatient claims for replaced cardiac medical devices.  These claims had dates of service during calendar years 2008 through 2013., All 296 payments reviewed for recalled cardiac medical devices did not comply with Medicare requirements for reporting manufacturer credits.  Medicare contractors incorrectly paid hospitals $7.7 million for cardiac device replacement claims rather than the $3.3 million they should have been paid, resulting in potential overpayments of $4.4 million., For all payments reviewed, manufacturers issued reportable credits to hospitals for recalled cardiac medical devices, but the hospitals did not adjust the claims with the proper condition codes, value codes, or modifiers to reduce payment as required.  The overpayments occurred because Medicare controls were not sufficient to ensure that hospitals properly reported manufacturer credits for cardiac devices. , We recommended that CMS instruct its Medicare contractors to notify the 210 hospitals associated with the 296 claims with potential overpayments of $4.4 million so that those hospitals can exercise reasonable diligence to investigate and return any identified overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule.  We also recommended that CMS educate providers on the requirements for reporting manufacturer credits and instruct its Medicare contractors to implement a post-payment process to follow up with hospitals that submit claims for certain cardiac device replacement procedures to determine whether an adjustment claim should be submitted.  Finally, we recommended that CMS consider studying alternatives to implementing edits in order to eliminate the current Medicare requirements for reporting device credits.  The full text of recommendations can be found in the report., In written comments on our draft report, CMS generally concurred with our first, second, and fourth recommendations and provided information on actions that it planned to take to address them.  However, CMS did not concur with our third recommendation because not all devices replaced under warranty or due to recall will result in a credit affecting payment.  This review and others have shown that hospitals are receiving reportable cardiac device credits and are not properly reporting these credits on claims.  While we acknowledge that hospitals may not receive a reportable credit in all cases of cardiac device replacement, previous OIG reviews have found that credits are provided for most cardiac devices replaced within the product lifecycle or due to recall.  We maintain that our recommendation is valid and that CMS should direct contractors to implement a post-payment process for claims with certain cardiac device procedures to ensure hospitals are complying with Medicare requirements for reporting manufacturer credits., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
136,A-09-17-03035,"Medicare Improperly Paid Suppliers for Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies Provided to Beneficiaries During Inpatient Stays","For our audit period (January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2017), Medicare should not have paid suppliers for any of the $34 million for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) that were provided during inpatient stays.  In addition, beneficiaries were held responsible for unnecessary deductibles and coinsurance of $8.7 million paid to the suppliers for the DMEPOS items.  Generally, Medicare should not pay a supplier for these items provided to a beneficiary during an inpatient stay.  Instead, all items must be provided directly by the inpatient facility or under arrangements between the facility and the supplier.  Medicare should pay the inpatient facility, through its inpatient claim, for all items provided to a beneficiary., Medicare overpaid the suppliers because the system edits that should have prevented or detected the overpayments were not adequate.  If the system edits had been designed properly since 2008, Medicare could have saved $223.1 million, and beneficiaries could have saved $56.3 million in deductibles and coinsurance that may have been incorrectly collected from them or from someone on their behalf., We recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) direct the Medicare contractors to (1) recover the $34 million in identified improper payments to suppliers in accordance with CMS's policies and procedures, (2) recommend that the suppliers refund to beneficiaries up to $8.7 million in deductible and coinsurance amounts that may have been incorrectly collected from them or from someone on their behalf, and (3) identify and recover any improper payments to suppliers after our audit period.  We also recommended that CMS (1) take all necessary actions, including seeking legislative authority, to require suppliers to refund to beneficiaries incorrectly collected Medicare Part B deductible and coinsurance amounts and (2) correct the system edits to fully prevent or detect overpayments to suppliers for DMEPOS items provided during inpatient stays.  , CMS concurred with all but one of our recommendations and provided information on actions that it planned to take to address our recommendations.  Regarding our recommendation that it seek legislative authority to require suppliers to refund to beneficiaries incorrectly collected deductibles and coinsurance, CMS stated that it will consider whether to recommend this proposal for inclusion in the President's next budget., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

In addition, beneficiaries were held responsible for unnecessary deductibles and coinsurance of $14.4 million paid to the acute-care hospitals for outpatient services.  Generally, Medicare should not pay an acute-care hospital for outpatient services provided to an inpatient of another facility, such as a long-term-care hospital.  Instead, the services should be provided under arrangements between the two facilities, and Medicare should pay the inpatient facility for all services provided to a beneficiary (as part of the facility's inpatient payment rate)., Medicare overpaid the acute-care hospitals because the system edits that should have prevented or detected the overpayments were not working properly.  If the system edits had been working properly since 2006, Medicare could have saved almost $100 million, and beneficiaries could have saved $28.9 million in deductibles and coinsurance that may have been incorrectly collected from them or someone on their behalf., We recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) direct the Medicare contractors to (1) recover the $51.6 million in identified improper payments to acute-care hospitals in accordance with CMS's policies and procedures; (2) instruct the acute-care hospitals to refund beneficiaries up to $14.4 million in deductible and coinsurance amounts that may have been incorrectly collected from them or from someone on their behalf; and (3) identify and recover any improper payments to acute-care hospitals after our audit period, which ended on August 31, 2016.  We also recommended that CMS correct the system edits to prevent overpayments to acute-care hospitals and instruct the Medicare contractors to more effectively educate acute-care hospitals not to bill Medicare for outpatient services they provided to beneficiaries who were inpatients of other facilities, but rather to provide those services under arrangements and look to the inpatient facilities for payment., CMS concurred with all of our recommendations and provided information on actions that it had taken or planned to take to address our recommendations."
138,A-02-17-01017,CMS Did Not Always Ensure Hospitals Complied With Medicare Reimbursement Requirements for Graduate Medical Education Audit A-02-17-01017 11-01-2018,"Prior OIG audits found that hospitals in six Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) jurisdictions counted residents (including interns) as more than one full-time equivalent (FTE) and, as a result, received excess Medicare graduate medical
                education (GME) reimbursement. This report summarizes the findings of those audits, providing information that may assist the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and MACs to achieve greater efficiency in the operation of Medicare.
                , Our objective was to determine whether CMS ensured that hospitals in selected MAC jurisdictions claimed Medicare GME reimbursement in accordance with Federal requirements., We analyzed the findings and summarized the results and recommendations from eight OIG audits that covered various periods between 2006 and 2013. For those audits, we obtained and reviewed data submitted by teaching hospitals in six selected
                MAC jurisdictions to determine whether hospitals claimed Medicare GME reimbursement in accordance with Federal requirements., CMS generally ensured that hospitals in selected MAC jurisdictions claimed Medicare GME reimbursement in accordance with Federal requirements. However, in seven of our eight audits, we identified some instances in which teaching hospitals
                did not always comply with Federal requirements when claiming Medicare GME reimbursement for residents. S pecifically, we found that hospitals in the six MAC jurisdictions we reviewed claimed GME reimbursement for residents who were claimed
                by more than one hospital for the same period and whose total FTE count exceeded one, totaling almost $4 million in excess Medicare GME reimbursement., The overstated FTE counts and excess reimbursement occurred because CMS did not have adequate procedures to ensure that hospitals do not count residents as more than one FTE. For example, CMS did not review resident data submitted by hospitals
                to detect whether a resident had overlapping rotational assignments (i.e., working at more than one hospital during the same period) or require the MACs to perform this work., We recommend that CMS take steps to ensure that no resident is counted as more than one FTE. This could include implementing policies and procedures to analyze resident data or requiring MACs to determine if residents claimed by hospitals
                in their jurisdiction were claimed as more than one FTE. Because our audits covered only six MAC jurisdictions across various fiscal periods, we believe that, if CMS took steps to ensure that all MAC jurisdictions implemented procedures,
                it could achieve significant cost savings., In written comments on our draft report, CMS agreed with our recommendation and stated that it has begun implementing a new database that hospitals will use to collect and report information on residents. According to CMS, the database will
                help ensure that no resident is counted as more than one FTE., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

We reviewed the medical records for 2,145 inpatient claims at 25 providers and found that all but 1 claim incorrectly included the
                diagnosis code for Kwashiorkor, resulting in overpayments in excess of $6 million. , The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification coding classification contained a discrepancy between the tabular list and the alpha index on the use of diagnosis code 260. In the alpha index, four other malnutrition diagnoses
                corresponded to diagnosis code 260, but in the tabular list, diagnosis code 260 was only for Kwashiorkor., The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) did not have adequate policies and procedures in place to address this discrepancy, resulting in a total potential loss of approximately $102 million during calendar years (CYs) 2006 through
                2014. Even though CMS was aware of the discrepancy, it did not take any separate action to address it. , While our reviews have successfully returned $5.7 million to the Medicare Trust Funds, we estimate that Medicare could have saved approximately $102 million from CYs 2006 through 2014 if the coding discrepancy had been immediately corrected.
                , We recommended that CMS (1) review provider Medicare claims to ensure that the diagnosis code for Kwashiorkor is being used correctly by providers and (2) formalize procedures for notifying providers of the correct way to bill diagnosis codes
                when there is a discrepancy in the coding classification between the alpha index and the tabular list. , In the individual reports, we recommended that each of the 25 hospitals refund the overpayments and strengthen controls to ensure full compliance with Medicare billing requirements. The 25 hospitals that we reviewed concurred with 42 of the
                50 recommendations and repaid $5.7 million in overpayments. All of the providers stopped incorrectly using diagnosis code 260., In written comments, CMS concurred with our recommendations.

145,A-01-17-00510,St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center Submitted Some Inaccurate Wage Data Audit (A-01-17-00510) 05-23-2019,"The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) uses area wage indexes to adjust Medicare payments to reflect local labor prices.  CMS calculates new wage indexes annually from wage data (wages, wage-related costs, and hours) submitted by hospitals.  We selected St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center (the Hospital), in Phoenix, Arizona, for this review because of its potential to significantly affect Medicare payments to many hospitals in its State in Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2019. , Because it applied to be considered a rural hospital for wage index purposes, the Hospital's wage data contributed to the Arizona rural wage index (RWI) for FFY 2019.  Federal law does not allow urban hospitals to be assigned wage indexes lower than the RWI for their State.  This is known as the ""rural floor.""  Accordingly, the Hospital's wage data will affect FFY 2019 payments to Arizona hospitals receiving the RWI or the rural floor wage index. , Our objective was to determine whether the Hospital complied with Medicare requirements for reporting wage data to be used in CMS's calculations of hospital wage indexes for FFY 2019. , We evaluated the Hospital's compliance with selected Medicare wage data reporting requirements., The Hospital did not always comply with Medicare requirements when reporting its wage data used by CMS for the FFY 2019 hospital wage index calculation. As a result, the Hospital overstated its wages and wage-related costs by $12.3 million and overstated its hours by 31,827. These errors occurred because the Hospital (1) reassigned the assembly and reporting of wage data to a new staff group, (2) did not have adequate review procedures to ensure that the correct dollars and hours were reported on the correct lines of the wage data worksheet, and (3) did not have adequate quality control over the entry of contract labor data into its accounting system. 
Because OIG has no authority to correct wage data, we contacted CMS and then the Hospital's Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) with our findings and suggested corrections. The MAC, with CMS approval, made the corrections. If the data had not been corrected by the Hospital's MAC as a result of this review, it would have raised the rural wage index from 1.0528 to 1.0627.  We estimated that, had it not been corrected, the overstatement of the rural wage index would have resulted in $11.6 million in overpayments for inpatient stays at the 54 Arizona hospitals that will receive the rural wage index or the benefit of rural floor wage index in FFY 2019., We recommend that the Hospital (1) ensure that all personnel involved in the process are fully trained to comply with Medicare wage data reporting requirements, (2) annually review all software scripts and manual procedures to ensure compliance with Medicare wage data reporting requirements, and (3) implement more effective quality controls over the entry of contract labor data into its accounting system. , In written comments on our draft report, the Hospital concurred with our findings and recommendations and described the steps it has taken to ensure its cost reports are prepared accurately in compliance with Medicare requirements., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
146,A-01-17-00500,Significant Vulnerabilities Exist in the Hospital Wage Index System for Medicare Payments Audit (A-01-17-00500) 11-21-2018,"We observed significant vulnerabilities in the wage index system while conducting 41 reviews of hospitals' wage data, with reports issued from 2004 through 2017.  CMS uses area wage indexes to adjust hospital payments annually to reflect local labor prices.  CMS calculates each area's wage index based on wage data submitted by acute-care hospitals in their Medicare cost reports.  Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) perform limited reviews of these data.  Federal law requires that the area wage indexes applied to urban hospitals in a State cannot be lower than the wage index for the rural hospitals in that State.  This provision is called the ""rural floor.""   Federal law allows some hospitals to reclassify to areas with higher wage indexes to receive higher payments.  ""Hold-harmless"" provisions in Federal law and CMS policy protect hospitals from having their wage indexes lowered because of the geographic reclassification of other hospitals., Our objective was to describe significant vulnerabilities we observed in the wage index system., We reviewed and analyzed laws and policies relevant to the vulnerabilities in the wage index system that we observed during our previous reviews of individual hospitals' wage data., We identified these significant vulnerabilities in the wage index system: (1) absent misrepresentation or falsification, CMS lacks the authority to penalize hospitals that submit inaccurate or incomplete wage data; (2) MAC limited reviews do not always identify inaccurate wage data; (3) the rural floor decreases wage index accuracy; and (4) hold-harmless provisions in Federal law and CMS policy pertaining to geographically reclassified hospitals' wage data decrease wage index accuracy.  As a result of these vulnerabilities, wage indexes may not always accurately reflect local labor prices and, therefore, Medicare payments to hospitals and other providers may not be appropriately adjusted to reflect local labor prices., We recommend that (1) CMS and the Secretary of Health and Human Services revisit the possibility of comprehensive reform, including the option of a commuting-based wage index.  In the absence of movement toward comprehensive reform, we recommend that (2) CMS seek legislative authority to penalize hospitals that submit inaccurate or incomplete wage data in the absence of misrepresentation or falsification; (3) seek legislation to repeal the law creating the rural floor; and (4) seek legislation to repeal the hold-harmless provisions in Federal law, allowing CMS to calculate each area wage index based on the wage data of hospitals that reclassify into the area and hospitals geographically located in the area provided that they do not reclassify out.  Additionally, we recommend that (5) CMS rescind its hold-harmless policy relating to geographically reclassified hospitals' wage data and (6) work with the MACs to develop a program of in-depth wage data audits at a limited number of hospitals each year, focusing on hospitals whose wage data have high levels of influence on the wage index of their area., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with recommendation 6.  CMS did not concur with recommendation 5, stating that its current hold-harmless policy promotes stability in wage indexes for hospitals in the reclassifying hospitals' original geographic areas.  We responded that promoting stability for those hospitals decreases wage index accuracy and suggested that if CMS will not rescind its policy, it should consider revising it to increase accuracy.  CMS also stated that it will consider whether to recommend for inclusion in the President's next budget the statutory proposals mentioned in recommendations 1 through 4."

These errors occurred because the Hospital officials did not (1) fully understand and follow the Medicare wage-data-reporting requirements in the CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual (the Manual) and (2) have adequate review and reconciliation procedures to ensure that the wage data it reported to CMS were accurate, allowable, supportable, and in compliance with Medicare requirements., Some errors raised the Hospital's average hourly wage and other errors lowered it.  Overall, for this year, the net effect of the errors did not cause a material change to the Hospital's wage index.  Because of the expected immaterial effect on payments, we did not request that the Medicare administrative contractor make any corrections to the Hospital's wage data for the FFY 2019 wage-index cycle., We recommend that the Hospital (1) ensure that all personnel involved in Medicare wage-data reporting are fully trained in compliance with the requirements in the Manual and (2) strengthen review and reconciliation procedures to ensure that the Medicare wage data it reports to CMS in the future are accurate, allowable, supportable, and in compliance with Medicare requirements., In written comments on our draft report, Lifespan, on behalf of the Hospital, concurred with four of our six findings.  Lifespan disagreed that the Hospital (1) could not support its contracted labor wages and associated hours and (2) incorrectly reported its nonphysician practitioner costs as Part A.  Lifespan described the Hospital's efforts to capture and produce more accurate cost report data.  However, Lifespan did not indicate whether the Hospital concurred with our recommendations., We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  We acknowledge the Hospital's right to appeal our findings., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
148,OEI-01-15-00320,"CMS Validated Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program Data, But Should Use Additional Tools to Identify Gaming Report  (OEI-01-15-00320) 05-01-2017","Accurate data are fundamental to CMS's quality-based payment programs, including Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR).  This evaluation focuses on CMS's efforts to ensure the integrity of IQR data.  IQR data are used to adjust payments on the basis of quality measures, so inaccurate data poses risks to payment accuracy.  CMS and CDC issued a Joint Reminder regarding their concerns about data being manipulated, or gamed, by hospital staff's not following CDC definitions for reportable infections. , We analyzed CMS validation data for payment year 2016 to determine the number of hospitals CMS selected for validation, why CMS selected them, and the outcome of the validation.  We conducted structured interviews with five stakeholder experts about hospital quality data and any concerns they had about the data or CMS's validation.  We also conducted interviews with CMS and CDC staff regarding quality assurance activities, as well as any analyses they conduct on the quality data.  Finally, we reviewed training materials that CMS and CDC offered to hospitals on how to report their quality data., For payment year 2016, CMS met its regulatory requirement by validating sufficient IQR data, which are used to adjust payments on the basis of quality.  Almost 99 percent of hospitals that CMS reviewed passed validation, and CMS took action against the six that failed, including reducing their Medicare payments.  CMS and CDC offer training to hospitals to help improve the accuracy of the quality data hospitals report.  However, CMS's approach to selecting hospitals for validation for payment year 2016 made it less likely to identify gaming of quality reporting (i.e., hospitals' manipulating data to improve their scores).  Furthermore, CMS did not include any hospitals in its targeted sample on the basis of their having aberrant data patterns. , To identify potential gaming or other inaccurate reporting of quality data, we recommend that CMS make better use of analytics to ensure the integrity of hospital-reported quality data and the resulting payment adjustments.  CMS could use analytics to increase the number of hospitals in its targeted validation sample.  It could analyze the data to identify outliers, determine which of those outliers warrant further review, and then add them to the sample.  CMS could use analytics to identify hospitals with abnormal percentages of patients having infections present on admission; this might help identify hospitals engaging in overculturing patients, one of the concerns highlighted in CMS and CDC's Joint Reminder.  CMS concurred with our recommendation."
149,OEI-06-14-00530,Adverse Events in Long-Term-Care Hospitals: National Incidence Among Medicare Beneficiaries Report  (OEI-06-14-00530) 11-30-2018,"<a class=""fancybox iframe"" href=""/newsroom/podcasts/2018/adverse-stream.html"">Adverse Events in Long-Term-Care Hospitals</a>, Amy Ashcraft, Deputy Regional Inspector General in the Office of Evaluation and Inspections in Dallas, is interviewed by Melissa Rumley, a public affairs specialist in Washington, D.C., In a series of reports from 2008 to 2016, OIG found that adverse events and temporary harm events are common, endanger patient health, and are costly to the Medicare program.  In a 2010 study, OIG found that 27 percent of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries experienced such events, costing Medicare approximately $4.4 billion a year.  OIG then expanded on this work by examining post-acute-care settings, finding that 33 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities and 29 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in rehabilitation hospitals experienced harm.  This report builds upon this prior work, focusing on Medicare stays in LTCHs., OIG reviewed medical records for 587 Medicare beneficiaries admitted to LTCHs in March 2014 to establish a national incidence rate of adverse events and temporary harm events.  The review was conducted in two stages.  In the first stage, nurses screened records for possible harm events.  In the second stage, physicians conducted a comprehensive review of the records flagged as containing possible harm events.  Physicians identified the harm events, determined the level of harm, whether the events were preventable, and the factors that contributed to the events., The Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that 21 percent of Medicare patients in LTCHs experienced adverse events, which are particularly serious instances of patient harm resulting from medical care.  The four categories of adverse events include outcomes such as prolonging a patient's LTCH stay or necessitating transfer to another facility; requiring life saving intervention; resulting in permanent harm; and contributing to death.  (Five percent of Medicare patients in LTCHs experienced adverse events that contributed to or resulted in their deaths.)  An additional 25 percent of patients experienced temporary harm events, which are patient harm that required medical intervention but did not cause lasting harm.  , The overall percentage of patients in LTCHs who experienced either type of harm (adverse events or temporary harm events) is 46 percent, higher than OIG found in hospitals (27 percent), skilled nursing facilities (33 percent), and rehabilitation hospitals (29 percent).  Patient stays in LTCHs present more opportunities for harm events because the stays are longer, but the number of harm events per patient day was similar between LTCHs and other post acute-care settings and lower than in non-LTCH acute-care hospitals. , Over half of these adverse events and temporary harm events (54 percent of harm events) were clearly or likely preventable.  Preventable harm events were often related to substandard care (58 percent) and medical errors (34 percent).  Forty-five percent of harm events were found to be clearly or likely not preventable, often because the patients were highly susceptible to harm due to other health conditions or poor overall health., In response to prior OIG work, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) took important steps to raise awareness of adverse events and temporary harm events and to reduce harm in several inpatient settings.  AHRQ and CMS should tailor their ongoing efforts to improve patient safety to address the specific needs of LTCHs.  We recommend that AHRQ and CMS collaborate to create and disseminate a list of potential harm events in LTCHs and that CMS include information about patient harm in its outreach to LTCHs.  CMS and AHRQ concurred with our recommendations."
150,OEI-06-15-00230,Hospitals Reported Improved Preparedness for Emerging Infectious Diseases After the Ebola Outbreak (OEI-06-15-00230) 10-16-2018,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the lead Federal agency responsible for medical support and coordination during public health emergencies.  In 2014, the domestic outbreak of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) tested U.S. hospitals' ability to respond to a serious infectious disease.  Very few hospitals received suspected or diagnosed cases of Ebola, but the disease's presence caused hospitals to assess and improve their preparedness for Ebola and other emerging infectious diseases (EIDs).  HHS agencies took action to respond to the outbreak, including providing guidance to hospitals and revising requirements for hospital emergency preparedness.  This study seeks to assess those efforts by describing the reflections of hospital administrators regarding the outbreak and the actions that hospitals have taken to improve readiness since 2014.  This study builds on OIG's body of work in emergency preparedness, which includes a prior study of hospital responses to a natural disaster., We administered an online survey to a national sample of hospitals in early 2017.  We selected a stratified sample of 410 hospitals that participate in Medicare and that have emergency departments.  We received responses from 368 of the 410 hospitals (a 90 percent response rate) and projected those findings nationally.  The survey included questions about hospital administrators' perceptions of preparedness in 2014 and 2017; actions taken to prepare; and challenges to sustaining preparedness for potential future EIDs.  We analyzed some responses by whether hospitals served as Special Pathogen Centers, as designated by ASPR, and/or as Critical Access Hospitals, as designated by CMS., Most hospitals in the United States were not prepared for the outbreak of Ebola in 2014, with 71 percent of hospital administrators reporting that their facilities were unprepared to receive Ebola patients.  By 2017, administrators from only 14 percent of hospitals reported their facilities were still unprepared for EID threats such as Ebola.  Hospital actions to improve preparedness included updating emergency plans, training staff to care for patients with EIDs, purchasing additional supplies, and conducting EID-focused drills.  Hospitals also used a wide range of resources provided by HHS., Although most hospital administrators believe that their hospitals are ready to respond to a future EID threat, they cited challenges to maintaining that preparedness, given competing priorities for hospital resources and staff time.  Administrators also cited the need to focus efforts on more common hazards, such as natural disasters, and cited difficulty in using government guidance to prepare for EIDs.  We also found that administrators from one-third of hospitals did not know their hospital's role in a tiered hospital framework designed by CDC to guide hospitals in receiving and treating cases of Ebola., A future EID threat could require substantial management and resources by hospitals, other healthcare providers, and government at all levels, including HHS.  To improve hospital preparedness and HHS assistance and oversight, we recommend that ASPR, CDC, and CMS continue to support hospital preparedness for potential EIDs by coordinating guidance and providing practical advice for all hospitals.  We also recommend that CDC clarify and promote the details and ongoing status of its tiered framework for hospitals, so that hospitals are clear regarding their responsibilities during an EID outbreak.  Further, we recommend that CMS add EIDs to the definition of ""all hazards"" in the State Operations Manual to promote inclusion of EIDs in hospital emergency planning.  ASPR, CDC, and CMS concurred with our recommendations."
151,A-05-16-00043,CMS Improperly Paid Millions of Dollars for Skilled Nursing Facility Services When the Medicare 3-Day Inpatient Hospital Stay Requirement Was Not Met Audit (A-05-16-00043) 02-14-2019,"According to Federal law, to be eligible for coverage of posthospital extended care services, a Medicare beneficiary must be an inpatient in a hospital for not less than 3 consecutive calendar days (3-day rule) before being discharged from the hospital.  CMS improperly paid 65 of the 99 skilled nursing facility (SNF) claims we sampled when the 3-day rule was not met.  Improper payments associated with these 65 claims totaled $481,034.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that CMS improperly paid $84 million for SNF services that did not meet the 3-day rule during 2013 through 2015.  , We attribute the improper payments to the absence of a coordinated notification mechanism among the hospitals, beneficiaries, and SNFs to ensure compliance with the 3-day rule.  We noted that hospitals did not always provide correct inpatient stay information to SNFs, and SNFs knowingly or unknowingly reported erroneous hospital stay information on their Medicare claims to meet the 3-day rule.  We determined that the SNFs used a combination of inpatient and non-inpatient hospital days to determine whether the 3-day rule was met.  In addition, because CMS allowed SNF claims to bypass the Common Working File (CWF) qualifying stay edit during our audit period, these SNF claims were not matched with the associated hospital claims that reported inpatient stays of less than 3 days. , We recommended that CMS ensure that the CWF qualifying inpatient hospital stay edit for SNF claims is enabled when SNF claims are processed for payment.  In addition, CMS should require hospitals to provide beneficiaries a written notification of the number of inpatient days of care provided during the hospital stay and whether the hospital stay qualifies subsequent SNF care for Medicare reimbursement so that beneficiaries are aware of their potential financial responsibility before consenting to receive SNF services.  CMS should require SNFs to obtain a written notification from the hospital and retain it as a condition of payment for their claims.  Further, CMS should educate both hospitals and SNFs about verifying and documenting the 3-day inpatient hospital stay relative to supporting a Medicare claim for SNF reimbursement., CMS concurred with our recommendations concerning the CWF qualifying inpatient hospital stay edit and educating hospitals and SNFs but did not concur with the remaining recommendations related to a coordinated notification mechanism among hospitals, beneficiaries, and SNFs.  After reviewing CMS's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

These checks can prevent individuals with disqualifying histories (e.g., convictions for patient abuse, patient neglect, and theft from patients) from being hired to care for beneficiaries.  The National Background Check Program (Program) provides grants to States to develop systems to conduct background checks of State and Federal criminal history records for prospective long-term-care employees., Congress mandates that OIG evaluate various aspects of Program implementation.  This report provides an assessment of States that concluded Program participation prior to 2017, and it also provides information for CMS to assist States that continue to participate in the Program., We reviewed grant-monitoring documents and financial reports to determine the extent to which the 10 States that concluded participation between 2013 and 2016 had implemented selected Program requirements.  Additionally, we surveyed the 10 States to collect information on their experiences with their respective background check programs., The 10 States that had concluded their participation in the Program by 2016 varied as to the degree to which they achieved implementation of Program requirements.  Seven of these 10 States implemented all or most of the selected requirements.  Three States did not have the necessary authority through State legislation and could not fully implement background check programs. , Of the background checks that 8 of the 10 States conducted, nearly 80,000 resulted in determinations of ineligibility for prospective employees.  The number of determinations of ineligibility and rates of ineligibility varied among the States (i.e., from less than 1 percent to 8 percent).  None of the States reported a reduction in available workforce for long-term-care facilities or providers as a result of the Program., To better protect beneficiaries from potential harm, CMS should take appropriate action to encourage participating States to obtain necessary authorities to fully implement Program requirements.  CMS stated that it concurred with our recommendation."

These overpayments were largely the result of HHAs improperly billing for services to beneficiaries who were not confined to the home (homebound) or were not in need of skilled services. , Our objective was to determine whether Excella HomeCare (Excella) complied with Medicare requirements for billing home health services on selected types of claims. , We selected a stratified random sample of 100 home health claims and submitted these claims to medical review., Excella did not comply with Medicare billing requirements for 41 of the 100 home health claims that we reviewed. For these claims, Excella received overpayments of $129,520 for services provided in calendar years (CYs) 2013 and 2014. Specifically, Excella incorrectly billed Medicare because beneficiaries (1) were not homebound or (2) did not require skilled services. On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Excella received overpayments of at least $6.6 million for the CY 2013 and CY 2014 period. All of the incorrectly billed claims are now outside of the Medicare reopening period; therefore, we are not recommending recovery of the overpayments. , We recommend that Excella exercise reasonable diligence to identify and return overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule and identify any returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with our recommendations. We also recommend that Excella strengthen its procedures to ensure that (1) the homebound statuses of Medicare beneficiaries are verified and continually monitored and the specific factors qualifying beneficiaries as homebound are documented and (2) beneficiaries are receiving only reasonable and necessary skilled services. , In written comments on our draft report, Excella disagreed with our findings and recommendations and stated that it intends to contest our findings through the appeals process. To address Excella's concerns for all claims we originally found in error, we requested our medical reviewer to again review all 70 of the claims originally found in error. Based on these reviews, our medical reviewer overturned, in part or full, 35 claims that it initially found in error.

168,A-05-17-00033,Medicare Allowable Amounts for Certain Orthotic Devices Are Not Comparable With Payments Made by Select Non-Medicare Payers A-05-17-00033 10-30-2019,"For calendar years (CYs) 2012 through 2015, Medicare allowable amounts for certain back, knee, elbow, and wrist orthotic devices increased from $631.8 million to $815.5 million.  We are concerned about the relationship of these increased costs to prices per orthotic device, and specifically whether Medicare allowable amounts are comparable with payments made by select non-Medicare payers., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare allowable amounts payments for certain orthotic devices were comparable with payments made by select non-Medicare payers., Our audit covered $2.8 billion in Medicare allowable amounts for 7.9 million orthotic devices billed under 161 Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes during CYs 2012 through 2015.  We calculated a nonstatistical estimate of payment differences for the 161 HCPCS codes reviewed that was based on a comparison of Medicare allowable amounts and payments made by select non-Medicare payers.  We estimated that Medicare would pay 80 percent of the payment differences and that the remaining 20 percent would be paid by the Medicare beneficiaries.  We limited our analysis to orthotic devices paid under Medicare fee schedules for the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia., Medicare allowable amounts for certain orthotic devices are not comparable with payments made by select non-Medicare payers.  For CYs 2012 through 2015, we estimated that Medicare and beneficiaries paid $341.7 million more than select non-Medicare payers on 142 HCPCS codes and $4.2 million less than select non-Medicare payers on 19 HCPCS codes.  Of the net $337.5 million payment difference, we estimated that Medicare paid $270 million and Medicare beneficiaries paid $67.5 million. Generally, Medicare allowable amounts are more than select non-Medicare payer payments because CMS does not routinely evaluate pricing trends for orthotic devices or payments made by select non-Medicare payers.  Instead, CMS uses statutorily mandated fee schedule payments that have an economic update factor applied to them annually.  In 2016, CMS was required to adjust certain durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies fee schedule amounts using information from the competitive bidding program, but this change did not affect the 161 orthotic device HCPCS codes reviewed for this report. , We identified 95 of the 161 codes for which the Medicare allowable amounts could be adjusted using existing legislative authority to make those amounts comparable with payments made by select non-Medicare payers.  For the remaining 66 codes, CMS would be required to seek new legislative authority to make those adjustments., We recommend that CMS (1) review the allowable amounts for 161 orthotic device HCPCS codes for which Medicare and beneficiaries paid an estimated $337.5 million more than select non-Medicare payers and adjust the allowable amounts, as appropriate, using regulations promulgated under existing legislative authority or if the allowable amounts cannot be adjusted using regulations promulgated under existing legislative authority, seek authority to align Medicare allowable amounts for these items with payments made by select non-Medicare payers; and (2) routinely review Medicare allowable amounts for new and preexisting orthotic devices to ensure that Medicare allowable amounts are in alignment with payments made by select non-Medicare payers or pricing trends., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendations and described its planned payment changes for certain orthotic devices., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

We determined that CMS consistently followed its established program procedures and applicable Federal requirements for 192 of the 215 winning suppliers associated with the sampled SPAs reviewed., While the overall effect on Medicare payments to suppliers was relatively small, we determined that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) did not consistently follow its established procedures and applicable Federal requirements for selecting suppliers during the bid process for 23 of the 215 winning suppliers.  This affected 99 of the 240 sampled SPAs.  Specifically, CMS awarded contracts to 10 suppliers that did not meet financial statement requirements and 13 suppliers that did not have the applicable license in at least 1 competition.  Additionally, CMS did not monitor suppliers in accordance with established procedures and Federal requirements for another 31 suppliers that did not maintain the applicable license as required by their contracts for the last 6 months of 2013., On the basis of our sample, we estimated that CMS paid suppliers $182,000 less than they would have received without any errors, or less than 0.03 percent of the $553.7 million paid under Round 2 during the last 6 months of 2013., We recommend that CMS (1) follow its established program procedures and applicable Federal requirements consistently in evaluating the financial documents of all suppliers; (2) ensure that suppliers have the applicable licenses for the specific competitions in which they are submitting a bid by continuing to work with State licensing boards; and (3) monitor supplier licensure requirements by implementing a system to identify and address potential unlicensed suppliers.

For 24 of the 100 sampled beneficiaries, Kelley Medical complied with the requirements.  However, for the remaining 76 beneficiaries, it did not comply with the requirements.  Specifically, Kelley Medical billed for orthotic braces that were not medically necessary for 67 beneficiaries and could not provide medical records for 9 beneficiaries., These deficiencies occurred because Kelley Medical did not always obtain sufficient information from the beneficiaries' medical records to assure itself that the claims for orthotic braces met Medicare requirements.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Kelley Medical received at least $4 million in unallowable Medicare payments for orthotic braces., We recommended that Kelley Medical (1) refund to the durable medical equipment Medicare administrative contractors $4 million in estimated overpayments for orthotic braces; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify and return any additional similar overpayments outside of our audit period, in accordance with the 60-day rule, and identify any returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendation; and (3) obtain as much information from beneficiary medical records as it determines necessary to assure itself that claims for orthotic braces meet Medicare requirements., Kelley Medical disputed our findings and recommendations.  After reviewing Kelley Medical's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  If the information in a beneficiary's medical record does not adequately support medical necessity, the supplier is liable for the payment amount of the orthotic brace.  In addition, our report clarifies that OIG recommendations do not represent final determinations by Medicare but are recommendations to HHS action officials. "

Generally Complied With Medicare Requirements When Billing for Inhalation Drugs Audit (A-09-16-02037) 12-14-2017,"For calendar years 2014 and 2015, Lincare Pharmacy Services Inc. (Lincare), which is located in Clearwater, Florida, generally complied with Medicare requirements when billing for inhalation drugs.  Of the 100 claim lines in our sample, 97 complied with the requirements.  However, the remaining three sampled claim lines did not comply with Medicare requirements.  Specifically, the beneficiaries' medical records did not support that the beneficiaries had conditions for which the use of inhalation drugs was considered reasonable and necessary.  As a result, Lincare received $48 in unallowable Medicare payments.   , These overpayments occurred because Lincare did not review the beneficiaries' medical records before billing Medicare.  However, Lincare informed us that, beginning in May 2016, its practice was to review the medical records for each inhalation drug order to verify that the drug being prescribed was considered reasonable and necessary for the beneficiary's diagnosis.  Because the change in Lincare's practice occurred after our audit period, we did not verify that the practice was effectively implemented.  , We recommended that Lincare ensure that the medical necessity of inhalation drugs is adequately supported in beneficiaries' medical records before billing Medicare.

In a 2014 letter to OIG, Members of Congress expressed concerns about the program's effect on access to DME and requested that OIG study this issue., We used Medicare claims to identify two populations of beneficiaries for whom Medicare paid claims before Round 2 of the Competitive Bidding Program started on July 1, 2013, but not afterward.  The first population included those with paid claims for CPAP/RAD devices (i.e., continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices or respiratory assist devices (RADs)); the second, those with paid claims for CPAP/RAD supplies.  We then drew two samples of beneficiaries for whom Medicare payments stopped after Round 2 began-one for whom device payments stopped and one for whom supplies payments stopped.  We then surveyed the physicians who had ordered devices or supplies for these beneficiaries.  In cases in which physicians reported a continued beneficiary need, we surveyed those beneficiaries to learn about their experiences after Round 2 began., Nearly all beneficiaries who in 2013 started using CPAP/RAD devices appeared to have continued access to them after Round 2 of the Competitive Bidding Program for DME began.  Our surveys provided some anecdotal context for a sample of beneficiaries for whom payments for devices stopped.  For example, physicians told us that the beneficiaries still needed CPAP/RAD devices, and beneficiaries generally reported continuing to use them.  For CPAP/RAD supplies, we found that Medicare payments stopped for 46 percent of beneficiaries in Round 2 competitive bidding areas compared to 33 percent in areas that were not competitive bidding areas.  About half of the beneficiaries we surveyed reported needing supplies, and nearly all of these beneficiaries reported getting needed supplies., Round 2 of the Competitive Bidding Program is unlikely to have disrupted beneficiary access to CPAP/RAD devices.  Our finding is consistent with CMS's conclusion that the program is not compromising beneficiary health outcomes.  Our analysis is inconclusive regarding whether the program disrupted beneficiary access to CPAP/RAD supplies.  We saw a bigger decline in claims for supplies in Round 2 competitive bidding areas than in areas that were not competitive bidding areas.  The decline may or may not indicate disruptions in receiving needed supplies.  For example, the decline may indicate that the program reduced the provision of unnecessary supplies, as CMS determined to be the case with Round 1 of the program."

CMS's new rates, which took effect on January 1, 2018, are based on lab-reported data:  rates paid by private payers such as private health insurers, Medicaid managed care organizations, and Medicare Advantage plans.  As part of the same legislation reforming Medicare's payment system, PAMA mandates that OIG conduct analyses it determines appropriate with respect to the implementation and effect of the new payment system.  This review focuses on CMS's implementation activities in 2017 and the new payment rates that took effect on January 1, 2018. , In this evaluation, we assessed CMS's progress in issuing the new rates that took effect in 2018.  To provide an update on the 2017 data reporting period, we conducted interviews with CMS staff; reviewed CMS's guidance and other documentation regarding lab outreach; conducted interviews with representatives from lab industry associations; analyzed preliminary lab-reported data; and reviewed CMS's analysis of lab-reported data and final payment rates.  This evaluation describes CMS's activities as of February 2018., CMS's analysis shows that new rates, effective January 2018, could save an estimated $670 million for the calendar year.  New Medicare rates are in line with savings estimated in previous OIG reports.  Rates for 75% of tests decreased from 2017 to 2018.  During the 2017 data reporting period, 1,942 labs reported their private payer data.  Although some labs reported difficulty in interpreting the reporting requirements, CMS's modeling demonstrated that increased reporting from more labs would not have had a meaningful effect on 2018 payment rates. , CMS performed limited quality assurance checks and relied on labs' self-certification of their reported data.  CMS's quality assurance activities that identified outliers or excluded data affected new rates for a few low-volume tests.  Labs experienced some one-time challenges in complying with a new policy, but CMS's limited quality-assurance efforts present an ongoing risk., Complete and accurate data are essential to setting payment rates for lab tests, and CMS should address challenges from 2017 to ensure data quality in the future.  Effective outreach can help ensure that all labs required to report data comply during future data reporting periods.  CMS can help ensure data quality by assessing quality assurance efforts and compliance activities.  OIG will continue to issue an annual analysis of the top 25 lab tests, based on Medicare Part B payments, and other analyses that OIG determines appropriate regarding the implementation and effect of the new payment system.

CMS will replace current payment rates with new rates based on current charges in the private health care market.  This is the first reform in 3 decades to Medicare's payment system for lab tests.  As part of the same legislation reforming Medicare's payment system, Congress mandated that OIG monitor Medicare payments for lab tests and the implementation and effect of the new payment system for lab tests.  This data brief provides the third set of annual baseline analyses of the top 25 lab tests., We analyzed claims data for lab tests that CMS paid for under Medicare's Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule.  These tests are covered under Medicare Part B, and do not include tests that Medicare paid for under other payment systems, such as the payment system for critical access hospitals or the Outpatient Prospective Payment System.  We identified the top 25 tests based on Medicare payments in 2016.  We also identified key statistics and emerging trends, including Medicare payments by procedure code, beneficiary, lab, ordering provider, and test category.  , Medicare paid $6.8 billion under Part B for lab tests in 2016, a total that changed very little in the 3-year period from 2014 through 2016.  Medicare payments were concentrated among a small number of tests and labs.  The top 25 tests by Medicare payments totaled $4.3 billion and represented 60 percent of all Medicare payments for lab tests in 2016.  The top 6 tests, which remained consistent with the top 6 from 
the previous 2 years, totaled $2.4 billion in 2016.  More than half of payments for the top 25 tests went to 1 percent of labs., Medicare payments for four categories of tests changed notably over time, despite little change in the total payments for all lab tests.  In comparison to Medicare payments for other test categories, payments for two categories of tests-an emerging category of tests and microbiology tests-increased notably from 2015 to 2016.  Drug tests and molecular pathology tests decreased notably during the same period.    , Lab tests play a critical role in delivering health care for the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who receive tests each year.  Although CMS paid for Medicare beneficiaries to receive over 1,000 different lab tests in 2016, 25 tests accounted for 60 percent of Medicare payments for all tests.  Changes in the Medicare payment rates for these 25 tests could have a significant impact on overall Medicare spending for lab tests when the new payment system for lab tests goes into effect in 2018.  The information presented here will be useful in monitoring the effects of changes to Medicare's payment system for lab tests.  We will continue to monitor Medicare payments for lab tests and to identify emerging trends."
178,A-01-15-00500,Many Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Stays Did Not Meet Medicare Coverage and Documentation Requirements Audit (A-01-15-00500) 09-27-2018,"Our prior reviews have found that some hospitals did not comply with Medicare coverage and documentation requirements for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs).  CMS s Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program found that the error rate for IRFs increased, ranging from 9 percent in 2012 to a high of 62 percent in 2016.  Our objective was to determine whether IRFs complied with Medicare coverage and documentation requirements for fee-for-service (FFS) claims for services provided in 2013., Our audit covered $6.75 billion in Medicare payments to 1,139 IRFs nation-wide for 370,872 IRF stays.  We selected for review a stratified random sample of 220 IRF claims (IRF stays) totaling almost $11.3 million in payments to 164 IRFs for calendar year 2013, the most recent claims data available at the time the audit started.  We used an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the medical records for the sampled IRF stays met coverage requirements.  In addition, we determined whether the medical records complied with Federal documentation requirements., IRFs complied with all Medicare coverage and documentation requirements specified for reasonable and necessary care for 45 of the 220 sampled stays.  However, for 175 of the sampled stays, corresponding to 135 IRFs, medical record documentation did not support that IRF care was reasonable and necessary in accordance with Medicare s requirements.  These errors occurred because many IRFs did not have adequate internal controls to prevent inappropriate admissions; Medicare Part A FFS lacked a prepayment review for IRF admissions; CMS s extensive educational efforts and postpayment reviews were unable to control an increasing improper payment rate reported by CERT since our 2013 audit period; administrative law judge (ALJ) hearings for IRF appeals did not always involve CMS participation to ensure that Medicare coverage and documentation requirements were accurately interpreted; and the IRF payment system did not align cost with payments, which may have provided IRFs with a financial incentive to admit patients inappropriately.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Medicare paid IRFs nation-wide $5.7 billion for care to beneficiaries that was not reasonable and necessary., We recommend that CMS (1) educate IRF clinical and billing personnel on Medicare coverage and documentation requirements and work with providers to develop best practices to improve internal controls; (2) increase oversight activities for IRFs, such as postpayment medical review; (3) work with the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals to ensure that Medicare coverage and documentation requirements for IRF care are fairly represented at ALJ hearings; and (4) reevaluate the IRF payment system, which could include a demonstration project requiring preauthorization for Medicare Part A FFS IRF stays modeled on Medicare Advantage practices, a study of the relationship between IRF PPS payments and costs and implementation of any steps necessary to more closely align them, and a consideration of the high error rate found in this report and CERT reviews in future acute inpatient rehabilitation service payment reform.  In its written comments on our draft, CMS concurred with our recommendations, described actions that it planned to take to address them, and reiterated its commitment to providing Medicare beneficiaries with high-quality healthcare while preventing improper payments."

Of the 186 cost transactions that we reviewed, 177 were correctly reported; however, the remaining 9 transactions, totaling $81,063, were incorrectly reported.  Of the 751 tissue-typing tests that we reviewed, 711 were correctly reported; however, the remaining 40 tests and 94 additional tests, with combined revenues totaling $50,000, were incorrectly reported., As a result of these reporting errors, NIT incorrectly calculated its total tissue-typing costs and Medicare reimbursement ratio, which is used to determine the Medicare reimbursement for kidney tissue-typing services.  Consequently, NIT received $45,940 in overpayments from Medicare.  These incorrectly reported costs and revenues were included on NITs FY 2012 cost report, which is outside of the 3-year reopening period., 
We recommend that NIT (1) work with the Medicare administrative contractor (MAC) to return $45,940 in potential overpayments identified in this report that are outside of the 3-year reopening period but within the 6 year lookback period in accordance with the 60-day rule, and identify the returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendation; and (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify and return any additional similar overpayments related to cost reports that were not part of our audit in accordance with the 60-day rule, and identify any returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendation., NIT concurred with our recommendations and provided information on actions that it planned to take to address our recommendations.  Regarding our finding that four cost transactions were incurred outside of the cost-reporting period, NIT stated that by removing these costs from the FY 2012 cost report, NIT would suffer the loss of reimbursement because the costs were not reported on the cost report in the year incurred and cannot be recaptured.  Although NIT concurred with our first recommendation, NIT stated that it will work with the MAC to return the overpayments identified after our consideration of its comment on our finding.  , We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.

Most ASCs (known as nondeemed ASCs) undergo a State agency survey to demonstrate that they meet these requirements; the others (known as deemed ASCs) are accredited by a Medicare-approved accreditor.  In addition to conducting regular surveys of nondeemed ASCs, States also conduct investigations of complaints that allege poor care or other problems at both types of ASCs.  Medicare beneficiaries are increasingly using ASCs for outpatient surgical procedures.  In fact, Medicare payments to ASCs increased from $3.4 billion in 2011 to $4.6 billion in 2017.  , OIG previously assessed the frequency of ASC State certification surveys in 2002, when we found that nearly a third of nondeemed ASCs had gone 5 or more years without a survey.  Since that time, outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections have raised concerns about patient health and safety at ASCs., We analyzed data provided by Medicare:  (1) State data on ASC certification surveys for nondeemed ASCs; and (2) complaints about deemed and nondeemed ASCs from fiscal years (FYs) 2013 to 2017.  Using these data, we assessed State survey performance against Medicare's requirements and analyzed trends in deficiency citations from State surveys and trends in complaint surveys., State Survey Coverage:  States largely met Medicare's requirements to survey 25 percent of nondeemed ASCs in FY 2017, and nearly half met Medicare's requirement to have surveyed all ASCs within the prior 6 years. , Trends in Deficiencies:  States cited 77 percent of nondeemed ASCs with at least one deficiency in their most recent survey, and one-quarter of ASCs had serious deficiencies.  From FY 2013 to FY 2017, infection control deficiencies were the most frequently cited category of deficiency, making up about a fifth of all deficiencies., Trends in Complaints:  From FY 2013 through FY 2017, States received complaints for fewer than 4 percent of ASCs each year, but the share of those complaints that required an onsite survey more than tripled. , CMS has made progress in strengthening oversight of ASCs and addressing vulnerabilities that OIG has previously identified, and more can be done.  The results of this new analysis can support CMS in further strengthening its oversight-particularly of the few States that are falling short in meeting its requirements.  It can also help CMS focus on ASCs' recurring challenges in meeting health and safety requirements, especially for infection control."

Specifically, Midwood incorrectly billed Medicare for beneficiaries whose conditions did not meet
                medical necessity requirements and billed for services that did not meet documentation requirements. These errors occurred because Midwood did not have adequate controls to prevent the incorrect billing of nonemergency ambulance transport
                claims. On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Midwood received overpayments of at least $19.2 million for the audit period. This amount includes claims with payment dates outside of the Medicare 4-year claim-reopening period., We made a series of detailed recommendations to Midwood. Among them, we recommended that Midwood (1) refund to the Medicare program the portion of the estimated $19.2 million overpayment for claims incorrectly billed that are within the Medicare

Medicare covers ambulance transports to only certain destinations, such as hospitals, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), and beneficiaries' residences.  Medicare also covers these transports from a SNF to the nearest supplier of medically necessary services (diagnostic or therapeutic sites) when the beneficiary is a SNF resident and those services are not available at the SNF.  The majority of the improperly billed claim lines (59 percent) were for transports to diagnostic or therapeutic sites, other than a physician's office or a hospital, that did not originate from SNFs.  As of the publication of this report, the total improper payment amount of $8.7 million included claim lines outside of the 4-year claim-reopening period., We recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) (1) direct the Medicare contractors to recover the portion of the $8.7 million in improper payments made to providers for claim lines that are within the claim-reopening period; (2) for the remaining portion of the $8.7 million, which is outside of the Medicare reopening and recovery periods, instruct the Medicare contractors to notify providers of potential improper payments so that those providers can exercise reasonable diligence to investigate and return any identified similar improper payments, and identify and track any returned improper payments; (3) direct the Medicare contractors to review claim lines for nonemergency ambulance transports to destinations not covered by Medicare after our audit period and recover any improper payments identified; and (4) require the Medicare contractors to implement nation-wide prepayment edits to ensure that payments to providers for nonemergency ambulance transports comply with Federal requirements., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions it had taken or planned to take to implement our recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Previous OIG reviews found that Medicare inappropriately paid for chiropractic services that were medically unnecessary, incorrectly coded, or undocumented.  After analyzing Medicare claims data, we selected for review Twin Palms Chiropractic Health Center, Inc.  (Twin Palms), in Venice, Florida.  Our analysis indicated that Twin Palms was among the top five chiropractors in Florida based on three Current Procedural Terminology codes billed to Medicare for chiropractic services. , Our objective was to determine whether chiropractic services that Twin Palms billed were allowable in accordance with Medicare requirements., For CYs 2014 and 2015, Twin Palms received Medicare Part B payments of $711,742 for 22,967 chiropractic services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  We excluded 619 chiropractic services as follows: services reviewed by the recovery audit contractors and other review entities (such as the Medicare Administrative contractors), services with payments less than $20, and services identified as cancelled.  From the remaining 22,348 services, totaling $704,246 in Medicare payments, we selected 100 services using a simple random sample., Some chiropractic services that Twin Palms billed were not allowable in accordance with Medicare requirements.  Of the 100 sampled chiropractic services in our sample, 46 were allowable in accordance with Medicare requirements.  However, the remaining 54 services were not allowable: 42 services were medically unnecessary, 11 services were insufficiently documented, and 1 service was incorrectly coded.  As a result, Twin Palms received $1,680 in unallowable payments.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Twin Palms received unallowable Medicare payments of at least $317,038 for CYs 2014 and 2015.  As of the publication of this report, this unallowable amount includes claims outside of the 4-year claims reopening period.  These unallowable payments occurred because Twin Palms did not have policies and procedures to ensure that the chiropractic services billed to Medicare were medically necessary, adequately documented, and coded correctly. , Among other things, we recommend that Twin Palms (1) refund to the Federal Government the portion of the estimated $317,038 overpayment for claims for chiropractic services that did not comply with Medicare requirements and are within the 4-year claims reopening period and (2) establish policies and procedures to ensure that chiropractic services billed to Medicare are medically necessary, adequately documented in the medical records, and coded correctly., In written comments on our draft report, Twin Palms partially concurred with our findings and recommendations.  Through its attorney, Twin Palms agreed with our assessment of 27 of the 55 chiropractic services that we identified as not allowable in our draft report but disagreed with our findings on the remaining 28.  Furthermore, Twin Palms provided additional documentation that it had not previously provided for eight claims.  Based on the additional documentation, the independent medical review contractor reversed its decision on one claim and changed the determination from unallowable to allowable.

Specifically, Medicare improperly paid 4,480 clinical laboratories and physician offices a total of $66.3 million for specimen validity tests billed in combination with urine drug tests.  Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) officials explained that medically necessary tests used to diagnose certain conditions (which include the same tests that can be used to validate urine specimens) that are performed on the same day as a urine drug test for a single beneficiary should be a rare occurrence.  , The improper payments occurred because providers did not follow existing Medicare guidance, and CMS's system edits were not adequate to prevent payment for specimen validity tests billed in combination with urine drug tests.  Improper payments decreased but continued to be made during our audit period as Medicare guidance was updated and CMS introduced new automated system edits.  Although CMS implemented on April 1, 2016, a system edit designed to identify and prevent these improper payments, we still identified $1.8 million in improper payments from April 1 through December 31, 2016.  At this observed rate, these improper payments would total $12.1 million over a 5 year period.  By strengthening its system edits and educating providers on properly billing for specimen validity and urine drug tests, CMS could save an estimated $12.1 million over 5 years., We recommended that CMS (1) direct the Medicare contractors to recover the $66.3 million in identified improper payments and (2) strengthen its system edits to prevent improper payments for specimen validity tests and instruct the Medicare contractors to educate providers on properly billing for specimen validity and urine drug tests, which could result in savings of an estimated $12.1 million over a 5-year period., CMS concurred with both of our recommendations and provided information on actions that it had taken or planned to take to address our recommendations.   , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

When a technician travels to a nursing facility or homebound patient and a specimen collection fee is payable, the Social Security Act provides for payment of a travel allowance.  Prior work found that travel allowances were at risk of being overpaid. , For this audit, we focused on travel allowance payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests made by one Medicare administrative contractor (MAC), Novitas Solutions, Inc.

Using computer matching, data mining, and data analysis techniques, we identified hospital claims that were at risk for noncompliance with Medicare billing requirements.  For calendar year 2017, Medicare paid hospitals $206 billion, which represents 55 percent of all fee-for-service payments for the year., Our objective was to determine whether Carolinas Hospital complied with Medicare requirements for billing inpatient and outpatient services on selected types of claims. , We selected for review a stratified random sample of 80 inpatient and 20 outpatient claims with payments totaling $1.5 million for our 2-year audit period (January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2017). , We focused our audit on the risk areas that we identified as a result of prior OIG audits at other hospitals.  We evaluated compliance with selected billing requirements., Carolinas Hospital complied with Medicare billing requirements for 55 of the 100 inpatient and outpatient claims we reviewed.  However, the Hospital did not fully comply with Medicare billing requirements for the remaining 45 claims, resulting in overpayments of $431,757 for the audit period.  The 41 inpatient claims had billing errors, resulting in overpayments of $431,431, and 4 outpatient claims had billing errors, resulting in overpayments of $326.  Specifically, the Hospital incorrectly billed:, On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that the Hospital received overpayments of at least $3.4 million for the audit period.  , We recommend that Carolinas Hospital refund to the Medicare contractor at least $3.4 million in estimated overpayments for the audit period for claims that it incorrectly billed; exercise reasonable diligence to identify and return any additional similar overpayments received outside of our audit period, in accordance with the 60-day rule; and strengthen controls to ensure full compliance with Medicare requirements., Carolinas Hospital disagreed that it incorrectly billed inpatient rehabilitation claims and beneficiary stays that should have been billed as outpatient.  In addition, the Hospital disagreed with our use of extrapolation, our inclusion of inpatient claims spanning two or more midnights, and our recommendation that it refund the extrapolated overpayment and identify and return any additional similar overpayments received outside of the audit period.  , We obtained independent medical review for all inpatient claims in our sample.  We provided the independent medical reviewer with all documentation necessary to sufficiently determine medical necessity for all inpatient claims, and our report reflects the results of that review.  Our statistical methods have been fully explained and repeatedly validated.

190,A-09-19-03027,Medicare Could Have Saved up to $20 Million Over 5 Years if CMS Oversight Had Been Adequate To Prevent Payments for Medically Unnecessary Cholesterol Blood Tests A-09-19-03027 05-11-2021,"A prior OIG audit found that Medicare paid providers that had billed for medically unnecessary laboratory tests.  Our preliminary review of Medicare claims identified providers that billed for direct-measurement, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol tests (direct LDL tests) and lipid panels (a blood test that reports four measures of lipids, including LDL cholesterol) for the same beneficiary on the same date of service; some of these providers billed the direct LDL test every time they billed the lipid panel.  These claims were at risk of noncompliance with Medicare requirements because, according to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), billing for a direct LDL test in addition to a lipid panel, while sometimes medically necessary, should happen with only limited frequency., Our objective was to determine whether payments made to providers for direct LDL tests that were billed in addition to lipid panels for the same beneficiary on the same date of service complied with Medicare requirements., Our audit covered Medicare Part B payments of about $35 million for direct LDL tests that were billed in addition to lipid panels for the same beneficiary on the same date of service and that had dates of service from 2015 through 2019 (audit period). , Payments made to providers for direct LDL tests that were billed in addition to lipid panels did not comply with Medicare requirements.  Under certain circumstances, it may be medically necessary for a provider to perform both tests for the same beneficiary on the same date of service.  However, CMS and Medicare contractors explained that these circumstances should happen with only limited frequency.  We determined that some providers billed LDL tests in addition to lipid panels for the same beneficiary on the same date of service more than 75 percent of the time.  (We refer to such providers as ""at-risk providers."")  In total, we identified $20.4 million of Medicare payments made to at-risk providers for direct LDL tests., Two Medicare contractors' review of medical records associated with 20 judgmentally sampled claims found that all of the direct LDL tests billed in addition to lipid panels were medically unnecessary.  Because the claim lines for the $20.4 million in payments to at-risk providers for direct LDL tests had characteristics similar to the claim lines in the judgmental sample, we determined that up to $20.4 million in payments were improper.  If CMS had had oversight mechanisms to prevent such payments, Medicare could have saved up to $20.4 million for our audit period., We recommend that CMS direct the Medicare contractors to: (1) develop oversight mechanisms to identify at-risk providers and prevent improper payments to these providers, which could have saved up to $20.4 million for our audit period, and (2) educate providers on the billing of direct LDL tests in addition to lipid panels.  Our detailed recommendations are in the report., CMS did not concur with our first recommendation and stated that ordering direct LDL tests and lipid panels together is permissible under Medicare payment rules on the basis of the physician's clinical judgment.  Regarding our second recommendation, CMS stated that it has already issued education on correct coding requirements for the proper use of modifiers on claim lines., We maintain that our finding and recommendations are valid.  Although we acknowledge that Medicare permits ordering direct LDL tests and lipid panels together, the at-risk providers in our audit routinely billed these tests together, and CMS's education does not specifically address such billing., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Although there are legitimate reasons that genetic testing has increased, these increases indicate areas of possible concern, such as excessive genetic testing and fraud, which may negatively affect beneficiaries.  In addition, Medicare requirements and guidance related to coverage of genetic testing have been limited and have varied among Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) jurisdictions.  Oversight by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the MACs is critical to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse related to genetic testing and to protect Medicare beneficiaries.  The information in this data brief may help CMS and other stakeholders to identify changes in the Medicare program, such as increased oversight, that could prevent fraud, waste, and abuse and protect Medicare beneficiaries., Because this report contains no recommendations, CMS did not provide written comments on our draft report but did provide technical comments, which we addressed as appropriate., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Therapists properly claimed Medicare reimbursement on the remaining 116 claims.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that during the 6-month audit period, Medicare paid $367 million for outpatient physical therapy services that did not comply with Medicare requirements.  These overpayments occurred because the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' controls were not effective in preventing unallowable payments for outpatient physical therapy services., By eliminating improper payments, Medicare could have saved an estimated $367 million on services provided by outpatient physical therapists from July 1 through December 31, 2013.  Therefore, we recommended that CMS (1) instruct the Medicare Administrative Contractors to notify providers of potential overpayments so that those providers can exercise reasonable diligence to investigate and return any identified overpayments, in accordance with Medicare guidelines, (2) establish mechanisms to better monitor the appropriateness of outpatient physical therapy claims, and (3) educate providers about Medicare requirements for submitting outpatient physical therapy claims for reimbursement., In written comments on our draft report, CMS generally disagreed with our findings and our first recommendation.  CMS stated that it disagrees with some of the policy interpretations and believes further analysis of the sampled claims is warranted to determine whether the claims met Medicare requirements.

These lines had dates of service in calendar years 2014 and 2015.  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 200 beneficiaries with 426 corresponding lines of service with payments totaling $148,198 during our audit period., Some payments that Medicare made to providers for polysomnography services did not meet Medicare billing requirements.  Of the 200 beneficiaries that we randomly selected, Medicare made payments to providers for polysomnography services that met Medicare billing requirements for 117 beneficiaries with 276 corresponding lines of service.  However, Medicare made payments for the remaining 83 beneficiaries with 150 corresponding lines of service that did not meet Medicare requirements, resulting in net overpayments of $56,668., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Medicare made overpayments of $269 million for polysomnography services during the audit period. , These errors occurred because the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) oversight of polysomnography services was insufficient to ensure that providers complied with Medicare requirements or prevent payment of claims that did not meet those requirements.  Without periodic reviews of claims for polysomnography services, MACs were unable to determine whether providers had received payments for claims that did not meet Medicare requirements or to take remedial action., We recommend that CMS instruct the MACs to recover the portion of the $56,668 in identified net overpayments that are within the 4-year reopening period.  We also recommend that CMS work with the MACs to conduct data analysis allowing for targeted reviews of claims for polysomnography services and educate providers on properly billing for polysomnography services, which could have reduced or eliminated an estimated $269 million in overpayments over the 2-year audit period.  The audit report includes all of the recommendations., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions that it planned to take to address them., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
201,A-04-20-07088,University of Michigan Health System: Audit of Medicare Payments for Polysomnography Services A-04-20-07088 06-03-2021,"Medicare administrative contractors nationwide paid approximately $885 million for selected polysomnography (a type of sleep study) services provided to Medicare beneficiaries during January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2018 (audit period).  Previous OIG audits of polysomnography services found that Medicare paid for some services that did not meet Medicare requirements.  These audits identified payments for services with inappropriate diagnosis codes, without the required supporting documentation, and to providers that exhibited questionable billing patterns.  After analyzing Medicare claim data, we selected for audit University of Michigan Health System (University of Michigan), a hospital provider located in Ann Arbor, Michigan., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare claims that University of Michigan submitted for polysomnography services complied with Medicare requirements., Our audit covered $1.9 million in Medicare payments to University of Michigan for 1,931 beneficiaries associated with 2,826 lines of polysomnography service billed using Current Procedural Terminology codes 95810 and 95811.  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 100 beneficiaries who received polysomnography services (166 lines of service) with payments totaling $112,147 during our audit period., University of Michigan submitted Medicare claims for some polysomnography services that did not comply with Medicare billing requirements.  Of the 100 randomly selected beneficiaries in our sample, University of Michigan submitted Medicare claims for polysomnography services that complied with Medicare billing requirements for 96 beneficiaries associated with 161 lines of service.  However, University of Michigan submitted Medicare claims for the remaining four beneficiaries associated with five lines of service that did not comply with Medicare requirements, resulting in overpayments of $3,127., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that University of Michigan received overpayments of at least $12,520 for polysomnography services during our audit period., The errors occurred because University of Michigan's policies and procedures did not address the processing of Medicare claims for polysomnography services to ensure that services billed to Medicare were adequately documented and coded correctly. , We recommend that University of Michigan (1) refund to the Medicare program the estimated $12,520 overpayment for claims that it incorrectly billed that are within the 4-year reopening period; (2) based on the results of this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; and (3) implement policies and procedures to ensure that Medicare claims for polysomnography services comply with Medicare requirements., In written comments on our draft report, University of Michigan disagreed with our findings associated with four lines of service billed with incomplete medical record documentation.  Additionally, University of Michigan asserted that our findings do not support extrapolation.  , We disagree with University of Michigan's assertion that the medical record documentation supported the need for testing.  For three beneficiaries (four lines of service), the face-to-face evaluation from the treating physician did not indicate that the physical examination was focused on sleep related disorders nor did it recommend sleep testing as part of the treatment plan for the patient.  The physician's progress notes in the face-to-face evaluations did not attribute the patient's symptoms or complaints to sleep-related disorders. , Therefore, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Of the 75 claims in our random sample, pharmacies had documentation to support the KX modifier for 65 claims but did not have support for the remaining 10. , The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS) intention for the KX modifier was to signify an attestation by the pharmacy that it had documentation proving that a beneficiary's organ transplant occurred when the beneficiary was eligible for Medicare coverage.  However, guidance in the Medicare Claims Processing Manual (the Manual) is not clearly written and additional guidance issued by claims processing contractors conflicted with the guidelines in the Manual.  , Pharmacies improperly received $3,973 in Part B reimbursement for the immunosuppressive drugs on the 10 claims.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Part B paid $4.6 million in reimbursement for immunosuppressive drugs billed with the KX modifier that did not comply with Medicare requirements. , We recommended that CMS (1) clarify language in the Manual to be consistent with its intent, as described above, and (2) instruct the claims processing contractors to process immunosuppressive drug claims without the KX modifier and educate pharmacies on the correct use of the modifier. , CMS concurred with our recommendations and provided separate technical comments on our report.

237,OEI-03-13-00630,Enhancements Needed in the Tracking and Collection of Medicare Overpayments Identified by ZPICs and PSCs Report  (OEI 03-13-00630) 09-27-2017,"This study continues OIG's body of work examining overpayments made by Medicare.  Overpayments can be identified by a number of key players including providers and Medicare contractors.  Recovering overpayments is critical to reducing improper payments in the Medicare program.  Past OIG work found that overpayments referred by program safeguard contractors (PSCs) for collection did not result in significant recoveries to the Medicare program.  As of 2012, CMS had transitioned the workload of most PSCs to six zone program integrity contractors (ZPICs).  In 2016, CMS began transitioning the remaining PSCs and ZPICs to unified program integrity contractors (UPICs).  OIG's work on both PSCs and ZPICs identified deficiencies in how contractors were tracking and reporting overpayment data.  This study provides an update on the collection of ZPIC- and PSC-referred overpayments and identifies ongoing challenges that contractors face in tracking and collecting overpayments identified by ZPICs and PSCs., Our study focused on overpayments that ZPICs and PSCs sent to Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) for collection in fiscal year (FY) 2014.  We collected and analyzed overpayment referral and collection data from ZPICs, PSCs, and MACs.  We also surveyed ZPICs, PSCs, and MACs to understand their procedures for tracking overpayment referrals and collections as well as barriers and challenges they face in performing these tasks., ZPICs and PSCs are key players in identifying Medicare overpayments, and they referred $559 million in overpayments in FY 2014 to the MACs responsible for collecting overpayments.  The dollars referred varied widely across ZPICs and PSCs, with just 2 of 10 contractors identifying half of the total overpayment dollars.  Based on ZPIC and PSC referrals, MACs sought to collect $482 million but collected only $96 million, or 20 percent; 80 percent remained uncollected as of September 30, 2015.  Although the collection rate remains low, it is almost three times the 7-percent collection rate for PSC identified overpayments that OIG found in its 2010 review when only PSCs were in existence.  MACs' collection rates ranged from a low of 11 percent for home health and hospice overpayments to a high of 59 percent for Part A overpayments referred by ZPICs and PSCs.  We found that ZPICs, PSCs, and MACs continue to experience challenges in tracking referrals and collections of overpayments.  In particular, the number and amount of overpayment referrals reported by ZPICs and PSCs often did not match to what was reported by MACs-with discrepancies totaling $130 million.  Furthermore, ZPICs, PSCs, and MACs used different report formats, which can lead to difficulty in tracking overpayment referrals., <img alt=""Collection Status of FY 2014 ZPIC- and PSC-Referred Overpayments, $559M referred by ZPICs and PSCs, $482M sought for collection by MACs, $96M collected, 80% not collected"" src=""/oei/reports/oei-03-13-00630.jpg"" width=""500""/>, We recommend that CMS identify and implement strategies to increase the identification of overpayments as well as MACs' collection of ZPIC and UPIC referred overpayments.  To increase collections, CMS should implement the surety bond requirement for home health providers and consider surety bonds for other providers based on their level of risk.  Furthermore, we recommend that CMS improve the ability of ZPICs, UPICs, and MACs to track overpayment referrals and collections by creating a standard report format for all contractors and requiring ZPICs, UPICs, and MACs to use a unique identifier for each overpayment.  CMS concurred with all of our recommendations except the one regarding surety bonds. CMS did not concur or non-concur with this recommendation; it stated that it is evaluating how to effectively implement the surety bond requirement while avoiding undue provider burden."

","<a class=""fancybox iframe"" href=""/newsroom/podcasts/2017/cms-mssp-stream.html"">CMS Ensured Medicare Shared Savings Program Beneficiaries Were Properly Assigned</a>, <a href=""/newsroom/podcasts/2017/cms-mssp-trans.asp"">Read the Transcript</a>, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers and suppliers to (1) improve quality of care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and (2) reduce health care costs.  Eligible providers and suppliers may voluntarily participate in the MSSP by creating or joining an accountable care organization (ACO).  
Beneficiary assignment is the basis for many key MSSP operations, such as determining an ACO's financial performance and reporting quality measures after each performance year (PY).  The designated ACO is responsible for the quality and cost of care of its assigned Medicare beneficiaries during a PY.  ACOs may be eligible to receive additional payments (i.e., shared savings payments) if they reduce health care costs and meet certain quality performance standards.  ACOs may also be responsible for a portion of any shared losses. , The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services complied with Federal requirements when assigning beneficiaries to ACOs in the MSSP during PYs 2013 through 2015 by ensuring that MSSP beneficiaries were assigned to only one ACO and were not assigned to other savings programs.  Consequently, this report contains no recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
239,OEI-02-15-00450,Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations Have Shown Potential for Reducing Spending and Improving Quality 08-28-2017 Report  (OEI-02-15-00450),"Medicare spending is expected to grow to $1.4 trillion by 2027.  To control this increase and promote quality and healthy populations, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented and is considering a number of alternative payment models that reward providers for the quality and value of services.  The goal is to incentivize providers to keep patients healthy and thus lower costs.  The Medicare Shared Savings Program is one of the largest alternative payment models.  As part of this program, health care providers form Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to coordinate care to reduce Medicare costs and improve quality of care.  Information about the extent to which ACOs are able to reduce Medicare spending and improve quality is critical to inform future developments as ACOs and other alternative payment models evolve., We analyzed beneficiary and provider data from CMS to describe the characteristics of ACOs.  We also analyzed spending and quality data to determine the extent to which ACOs reduced Medicare spending and improved quality in the first 3 years of the program.  Lastly, we analyzed spending and utilization data to describe how high-performing ACOs reduced spending and made changes to utilization for key services. , Over the first 3 years of the program, 428 participating Shared Savings Program ACOs served 9.7 million beneficiaries.  During that time, most of these ACOs reduced Medicare spending compared to their benchmarks, achieving a net spending reduction of nearly $1 billion.  At the same time, ACOs generally improved the quality of care they provided, based on CMS data on quality measures.  In the first 3 years, ACOs improved their performance on most (82 percent) of the individual quality measures.  ACOs also outperformed fee-for-service providers on most (81 percent) of the quality measures.  Further, a small subset of ACOs showed substantial reductions in Medicare spending while providing high-quality care.  These high-performing ACOs reduced spending by an average of $673 per beneficiary for key Medicare services during the review period.  In contrast, other Shared Savings Program ACOs and the national average for fee-for-service providers showed an increase in per beneficiary spending for key Medicare services., With any major payment reform, time may be needed for organizations to make changes to improve quality and lower costs.  While policy changes may be warranted, ACOs show promise in reducing spending and improving quality.  However, additional information about high-performing ACOs would inform the future direction of the Shared Savings Program as well as other alternative payment models."
240,OEI-01-16-00180,Using Health IT for Care Coordination: Insights from Six Medicare Accountable Care Organizations Report  (OEI-01-16-00180) 05-17-2019,"This evaluation provides insights into how select Medicare Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have used health information technology (health IT) tools to better coordinate care for their patients.  Health IT has significantly enhanced providers' opportunities to coordinate patient care across health care settings.  Care coordination helps ensure that patients' needs for health services are met across multiple encounters and settings.  CMS has identified care coordination as integral to achieving better care, improved health, and lower costs., We purposively selected six ACOs on the basis of their performance on a quality measure focused on care coordination and patient safety, a minimum of 3 years of experience as a Medicare ACO, geographic variation, and recommendations from CMS and ONC.  We interviewed administrative staff and providers onsite at each of the six ACOs.  Our discussions covered how ACOs use health IT to coordinate care for their patients and the challenges they face in doing so., Overall, health IT tools have enabled the six ACOs we visited to better coordinate patient care.  ACOs that used a single electronic health record (EHR) system across their provider networks were able to share data in real time.  A small number of ACOs had access to robust health information exchanges (HIEs), which gave ACOs access to patient data even when patients saw providers outside the ACOs' networks.  Most of the ACOs we visited use data analytics to inform their care coordination by identifying and grouping patients according to the potential severity and cost of their health conditions.  However, the ACOs we visited still face challenges in these areas.  ACOs using multiple EHR systems had to rely on other means to share data between providers, such as phone calls and faxes.  ACOs also faced challenges from physician burnout due to the workload of managing EHRs.  Most of the ACOs had access to HIEs with little or incomplete data, making it difficult to coordinate care when patients saw providers outside the ACOs' networks.  Few of the ACOs use analytics to customize care to an individual patient's needs., The ACOs we visited have used health IT to aid in care coordination in a variety of ways.  However, the full potential of health IT has not been realized.  ACOs vary in the extent to which they can rely on health IT tools.  The Department of Health and Human Services has promoted the use of these tools for the promise they hold to help patients achieve better outcomes at lower costs.  This work showcases some of the advances ACOs have made as well as challenges that remain for fulfilling that promise."

Although these financial relationships may provide important opportunities to increase medical research and enhance medical knowledge, they also can raise concerns because of their potential to influence the decision-making of health care providers.  The transparency of the Open Payments program reveals the nature and extent of these relationships and has the potential to discourage the development of inappropriate financial relationships.  However, the program can benefit the public only if the data reported are complete and accurate. , To determine the extent to which data reported were missing elements, or were inaccurate or inconsistent, we downloaded data for 2015 from the Open Payments website in June 2016.  To determine the role of CMS in validating Open Payments data received from manufacturers and group purchasing organizations, we reviewed policies and procedures and other information that CMS provided regarding its oversight., Of 11.9 million records published on the Open Payments website for 2015, less than 1 percent were missing required data elements.  Although the Open Payments data elements reported to CMS were complete overall, we did identify records that contained inaccurate, imprecise, or inconsistent information.  These include records containing drug and device names that do not match the definitions of these data elements; national drug codes (NDCs) that were not found in multiple Food and Drug Administration databases or other drug information resources; and payment dates from a different reporting year.  CMS did note that it has conducted outreach to address data concerns with manufacturers and group purchasing organizations.  CMS also reported that it is still compiling a list of noncompliant manufacturers and group purchasing organizations for further investigation., We recommend that CMS take a number of practical steps to improve the accuracy, precision, and consistency of the data to better help consumers use the information: (1) ensure that records contain all required data; (2) strengthen validation rules and revise data-element definitions so that actual drug and device names must be reported; (3) revise the definition of the device-name data element so that the information reported is required to be more specific; and (4) ensure that manufacturers and group purchasing organizations report valid NDCs for drugs. CMS concurred with all four of our recommendations."

Our objectives were to determine (1) the prevalence of incidents of potential abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries residing in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) who had a hospital emergency room (ER) Medicare claim in calendar year 2016 containing a high-risk diagnosis code, (2) whether these incidents of potential abuse or neglect were properly reported by the SNFs, (3) whether the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and State Survey Agencies (Survey Agencies) reported findings of substantiated abuse to local law enforcement, and (4) the extent to which CMS requires incidents of potential abuse or neglect to be recorded and tracked., Our review covered 37,607 high-risk hospital ER claims for 34,820 Medicare beneficiaries residing in SNFs during calendar year 2016.  We and the Survey Agencies reviewed supporting documentation for 256 high-risk hospital ER Medicare claims to determine whether the incidents were the result of potential abuse or neglect, and if so, reported to the Survey Agencies.  We reviewed incidents that were not included in our sampling frame to determine whether CMS and the Survey Agencies reported findings of substantiated abuse to local law enforcement.  We assessed how CMS tracks all incidents of potential abuse or neglect., We determined that an estimated one in five high-risk hospital ER Medicare claims for treatment provided in calendar year 2016 were the result of potential abuse or neglect, including injury of unknown source, of beneficiaries residing in a SNF.  We determined that SNFs failed to report many of these incidents to the Survey Agencies in accordance with applicable Federal requirements.  We also determined that several Survey Agencies failed to report some findings of substantiated abuse to local law enforcement.  Lastly, we determined that CMS does not require all incidents of potential abuse or neglect and related referrals made to law enforcement and other agencies to be recorded and tracked in the Automated Survey Processing Environment Complaints/Incidents Tracking System.  Preventing, detecting, and combating elder abuse requires CMS, Survey Agencies, and SNFs to meet their responsibilities.  , We recommend that CMS take action to ensure that incidents of potential abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries residing in SNFs are identified and reported by working with the Survey Agencies to improve training for staff of SNFs on how to identify and report incidents of potential abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries, clarifying guidance to define and provide examples of incidents of potential abuse or neglect, requiring the Survey Agencies to record and track all incidents of potential abuse or neglect in SNFs and referrals made to local law enforcement and other agencies, and monitoring the Survey Agencies' reporting of findings of substantiated abuse to local law enforcement., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendations and provided details about the actions it has taken and plans to take to ensure incidents of potential abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries in SNFs are identified and reported., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Using CERT data, we identified 100 error-prone providers from 2014 through 2017.  Of the $5.8 million reviewed by CERT, $3.5 million was incorrect, which is an improper payment rate of 60.7 percent.  We determined that during the same period, Medicare made $19.1 billion in FFS payments to these 100 error-prone providers., The term ""error-prone provider"" is an OIG-created term to refer to a list of providers identified as having higher rate of errors in the CERT sample data.  When used to describe OIG analysis of CERT data from 2014 through 2017, the term refers to providers that had at least one error in each of the 4 CERT years analyzed, an error rate of higher than 25 percent in each of the 4 CERT years analyzed, and a total error amount of at least $2,500.  An error-prone provider is statistically more likely to submit an improper claim than the average provider. , We recommend that CMS: (1) review the list of 100 error-prone providers identified in this audit and take specific action as appropriate, such as prior authorization, prepayment reviews, and postpayment reviews, and (2) use annual CERT data to identify individual providers that have an increased risk of receiving improper payments and apply additional program integrity tools to these providers., In written comments on our draft report, CMS did not concur with our recommendations.  CMS disagreed with our methodology for identifying error-prone providers and suppliers.  Additionally, CMS stated that it previously attempted to use CERT data to identify error-prone providers and suppliers but found that CERT data was ineffective for this purpose and discontinued the practice., After reviewing CMS's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations remain valid.  We maintain that CMS can improve its ability to detect these types of providers by using the provider-level CERT data along with its existing oversight efforts., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

257,OEI-03-16-00540,Medicare Part B Drug Payments:  Impact of Price Substitutions Based on 2014 Average Sales Prices (OEI 03-16-00540) 08-30-2017,"<p style=""padding:7px 5px 2px 5px;""><b>Results of the Medicare Part B Price-Substitution Policy</b><br/>Click the graphic to enlarge, When Congress established average sales price (ASP) as the basis for Medicare Part B drug reimbursement, it also provided a mechanism for monitoring market prices and limiting potentially excessive payment amounts.  The Social Security Act mandates that OIG compares ASPs with average manufacturer prices (AMPs).  If OIG finds that the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by a certain percentage (currently 5 percent), the Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to substitute the ASP-based payment amount with a lower calculated rate.  Through regulation, CMS outlined that it would make this substitution only if the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by 5 percent in the 2 previous quarters or 3 of the previous 4 quarters.  

Over the last decade, OIG has produced annual reports aggregating the results of our mandated quarterly ASP to AMP comparisons.  This annual report quantifies the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries that are a direct result of CMS's price-substitution policy based on 2014 average sales prices, and this report also offers ways for additional savings.

<h3>HOW WE DID THIS STUDY</h3>
To determine the effects of the price substitution policy, we determined the difference between ASP-based payment and AMP-based payment for each drug with a price substitution.  We then applied this difference to the Medicare utilization for each of these drugs.  To account for a 3 quarter lag between the reporting of pricing data and applying price substitutions, we used drug utilization data for the fourth quarter of 2014 through the third quarter of 2015 to calculate the savings based on 2014 ASP data.

<h3>WHAT WE FOUND</h3>
<ul>
<li>CMS lowered Part B reimbursement for 14 drugs on the basis of data from 2014.</li>
<li>CMS's price-substitution policy saved Medicare and its beneficiaries $24 million over 1 year based on 2014 data.</li>
<li>Medicare and its beneficiaries could have saved up to an additional $9 million over 1 year by expanding the price-substitution criteria to include drugs that exceeded the 5 percent threshold in a single quarter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHAT WE RECOMMEND</h3>
Because of the potential for savings to Medicare beneficiaries and the program, OIG recommends that CMS expand the price-substitution policy.  CMS did not concur with the recommendation.  However, CMS stated that as additional data becomes available and as it continues to gain experience with the price substitution policy, it will consider further changes as necessary.  OIG recognizes that CMS, in setting policy for payment substitution, needs to achieve an important balance between safeguarding access to drugs and ensuring that Medicare and its beneficiaries do not overpay for drugs.  To provide greater flexibility and achieve this continued balance, any future expansion of the payment-substitution policy could contain a provision that would prevent a price substitution when there are indications that the substitution amount is below the provider acquisition cost.

<li>Medicare and its beneficiaries could have saved up to an additional $9 million over 1 year by expanding the price-substitution criteria to include drugs that exceeded the 5 percent threshold in a single quarter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHAT WE RECOMMEND</h3>
Because of the potential for savings to Medicare beneficiaries and the program, OIG recommends that CMS expand the price-substitution policy.  CMS did not concur with the recommendation.  However, CMS stated that as additional data becomes available and as it continues to gain experience with the price substitution policy, it will consider further changes as necessary.  OIG recognizes that CMS, in setting policy for payment substitution, needs to achieve an important balance between safeguarding access to drugs and ensuring that Medicare and its beneficiaries do not overpay for drugs.  To provide greater flexibility and achieve this continued balance, any future expansion of the payment-substitution policy could contain a provision that would prevent a price substitution when there are indications that the substitution amount is below the provider acquisition cost.

The Social Security Act mandates that OIG compare ASPs with average manufacturer prices (AMPs).  If OIG finds that the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by a certain percentage (currently 5 percent), the Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to substitute the ASP based payment amount with a lower calculated rate.  Through regulation, CMS outlined that it would make this substitution only if the ASP for a drug exceeded the AMP by 5 percent in the 2 previous quarters or 3 of the previous 4 quarters. , Over the last decade, OIG has produced annual reports aggregating the results of our mandated quarterly ASP to AMP comparisons.  This annual report quantifies the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries that are a direct result of CMS's price substitution policy based on 2015 average sales prices, and this report also offers recommendations for achieving additional savings., To determine the effects of the price substitution policy, we determined the difference between ASP-based payment and AMP-based payment for each drug with a price substitution.  We then applied this difference to the Medicare utilization for each of these drugs.  To account for a 3 quarter lag between the reporting of pricing data and applying price substitutions, we used drug utilization data for the fourth quarter of 2015 through the third quarter of 2016 to calculate the savings based on 2015 ASP data.  , Because of the potential for savings to Medicare beneficiaries and the program, OIG recommends that CMS expand the price-substitution policy.  CMS did not concur with the recommendation.  However, CMS stated that as additional data becomes available and as it continues to gain experience with the price substitution policy, it will consider further changes as necessary.

260,OEI-02-16-00570,Vulnerabilities in the Medicare Hospice Program Affect Quality Care and Program Integrity: An OIG Portfolio Report  (OEI-02-16-00570) 07-30-2018,"<a href=""/newsroom/media-materials/2018/hospice/"">Media Materials: Vulerabilities in Hospice Care</a>, OIG is committed to ensuring that beneficiaries receive quality care and to safeguarding the hospice benefit.  OIG has produced numerous evaluations and audits of the hospice program, including in-depth looks at specific levels of care and settings.  OIG has also conducted criminal and civil investigations of hospice providers, leading to the conviction of individuals, monetary penalties, and civil False Claims Act settlements.  Through this extensive work, OIG has identified vulnerabilities in the program.  This portfolio highlights key vulnerabilities and presents recommendations for protecting beneficiaries and improving the program., The portfolio synthesizes OIG's body of work on the Medicare hospice benefit.  It covers hospice care since 2005 and describes the growth in hospice utilization and reimbursement.  The portfolio also summarizes key vulnerabilities that OIG has identified and continues to monitor. , Hospice care can provide great comfort to beneficiaries and their families and caregivers at the end of a beneficiary's life.  Hospice use has grown steadily over the past decade, with Medicare paying $16.7 billion for this care in 2016.  It is an increasingly important benefit for the Medicare population; 1.4 million beneficiaries received hospice care in 2016., However, OIG has identified vulnerabilities in the program.  OIG found that hospices do not always provide needed services to beneficiaries and sometimes provide poor quality care.  In some cases, hospices were not able to effectively manage symptoms or medications, leaving beneficiaries in unnecessary pain for many days., OIG also found that beneficiaries and their families and caregivers do not receive crucial information to make informed decisions about their care.  Further, hospices' inappropriate billing costs Medicare hundreds of millions of dollars.  This includes billing for an expensive level of care when the beneficiary does not need it.  Also, a number of fraud schemes in hospice care negatively affect beneficiaries and the program.  Some fraud schemes involve enrolling beneficiaries who are not eligible for hospice care, while other schemes involve billing for services never provided., Lastly, the current payment system creates incentives for hospices to minimize their services and seek beneficiaries who have uncomplicated needs.  A hospice is paid for every day a beneficiary is in its care, regardless of the quantity or quality of services provided on that day.  While CMS made some changes to payments, the underlying structure of the payment system remains unchanged., We recommend that CMS implement 15 specific actions that relate to 7 areas for improvement.  CMS should strengthen the survey process-its primary tool to promote compliance-to better ensure that hospices provide beneficiaries with needed services and quality care.  CMS should also seek statutory authority to establish additional remedies for hospices with poor performance.  Also, CMS should develop and disseminate additional information on hospices, including complaint investigations, to help beneficiaries and their families and caregivers make informed choices about hospice care.  CMS should educate beneficiaries and their families and caregivers about the hospice benefit, working with its partners to make available consumer-friendly information.  CMS should promote physician involvement and accountability to ensure that beneficiaries get appropriate care., To reduce inappropriate billing, CMS should strengthen oversight of hospices.  This includes analyzing claims data to identify hospices that engage in practices that raise concerns.  Lastly, CMS should take steps to tie payment to beneficiary care needs and quality of care to ensure that services rendered adequately serve beneficiaries' needs, seeking statutory authority if necessary., In our draft report to CMS, we recommended 16 specific actions.  CMS concurred with six recommendations, did not concur with nine, and neither concurred nor nonconcurred with one.  We considered CMS's comments carefully, and we clarified and combined two of our recommendations.  We remain committed to our recommendations and will continue to work with CMS to promote their implementation."
261,OEI-03-15-00060,"Medicare Advantage Encounter Data Show Promise for Program Oversight, But Improvements Are Needed Report  (OEI-03-15-00060) 01-16-2018","For the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, CMS contracts with private insurance companies, known as MA organizations (MAOs), to provide Medicare coverage for 18.6 million beneficiaries.  In fiscal year 2016, MA expenses reached $200 billion.  In 2012, CMS began collecting detailed information from MAOs regarding each service provided to MA beneficiaries.  This information is known as MA encounter data.  These data must be accurate for CMS to review the medical care that beneficiaries are receiving and use the data to increase payments to MAOs for beneficiaries in poorer health.  Ensuring the completeness, validity, and timeliness of the MA encounter data is also critical to safeguard program integrity and to ensure that MA beneficiaries receive needed medical care., We analyzed 102 million MA encounter records from the first quarter of 2014 to determine the extent to which data contained in CMS's Integrated Data Repository were complete, valid, and timely.  In addition, to review the actions that CMS has taken to address errors in MA encounter data, we analyzed CMS's responses to a structured questionnaire and relevant policy and procedural documentation., Overall, 28 percent of MA encounter records that we reviewed from the first quarter of 2014 had at least 1 potential error, but CMS reported correcting the majority of these records.  According to CMS, most of these potential errors were created when CMS removed provider identifiers from records in its edit process.  With CMS's subsequent correction, only 5 percent of the records in our review would contain a potential error.  Types of potential errors included inactive or invalid billing provider identifiers; duplicated service lines; missing required data; inconsistent dates; and beneficiary information that did not match CMS's records.  Just 1 percent of MAOs submitted 51 percent of the records with potential error(s).  Some of these errors may raise concerns about the legitimacy of services documented in the data, such as records that lacked a beneficiary last name or a valid identifier for the billing provider., Although MAOs must submit identifiers for billing providers, CMS does not require MAOs to submit identifiers for ordering or referring providers and requires identifiers for rendering providers only under certain circumstances.  Identifiers for ordering and referring providers-and in some cases, for rendering providers-were frequently absent from encounter data, which limits the use of these data for vital program oversight and enforcement activities.  CMS's key control to ensure data integrity has been its edit process, which rejects data that do not pass certain checks.  However, CMS has not tracked whether MAOs respond when this process rejects data.  CMS has plans to implement additional compliance activities to ensure data integrity, but it has not established performance measures that monitor MAOs' submission of records with complete and valid data. , We recommend that CMS take actions as appropriate to address potential errors in the MA encounter data; provide targeted oversight of MAOs that submitted a higher percentage of records with potential errors; ensure that billing provider identifiers are active and valid on all records; require MAOs to submit ordering and referring provider identifiers and ensure the submission of rendering provider identifiers for applicable records; track how MAOs respond to edits that reject data; and establish and monitor performance thresholds related to MAOs' submission of records with complete and valid data.  CMS concurred with four of our seven recommendations."
262,A-07-16-01165,"Medicare Advantage Compliance Audit of Diagnosis Codes That Humana, Inc., (Contract H1036) Submitted to CMS","Under the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) makes monthly payments to MA organizations according to a system of risk adjustment that depends on the health status of each enrollee.  Accordingly, MA organizations are paid more for providing benefits to enrollees with diagnoses associated with more intensive use of health care resources than to healthier enrollees who would be expected to require fewer health care resources., To determine the health status of enrollees, CMS relies on MA organizations to collect diagnosis codes from their providers and submit these codes to CMS.  CMS then maps certain diagnosis codes, on the basis of similar clinical characteristics and severity and cost implications, into Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCCs).  CMS makes higher payments for enrollees who receive diagnoses that map to HCCs., For this audit, we reviewed one of the contracts that Humana, Inc., has with CMS with respect to the diagnosis codes that Humana submitted to CMS.  Our objective was to determine whether Humana submitted diagnosis codes to CMS for use in the risk adjustment program in accordance with Federal requirements., We selected a sample of 200 enrollees with at least 1 diagnosis code that mapped to an HCC for 2015.  Humana provided medical records as support for 1,525 HCCs associated with the 200 enrollees.  We used an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the diagnosis codes complied with Federal requirements., Humana did not submit some diagnosis codes to CMS for use in the risk adjustment program in accordance with Federal requirements.  First, although most of the diagnosis codes that Humana submitted were supported in the medical records and therefore validated 1,322 of the 1,525 sampled enrollees' HCCs, the remaining 203 HCCs were not validated and resulted in overpayments.  These 203 unvalidated HCCs included 20 HCCs for which we identified 22 other, replacement HCCs for more and less severe manifestations of the diseases.  Second, there were an additional 15 HCCs for which the medical records supported diagnosis codes that Humana should have submitted to CMS but did not., Thus, the risk scores for the 200 sampled enrollees should not have been based on the 1,525 HCCs.  Rather, the risk scores should have been based on 1,359 HCCs (1,322 validated HCCs + 22 other HCCs + 15 additional HCCs).  As a result, we estimated that Humana received at least $197.7 million in net overpayments for 2015.  These errors occurred because Humana's policies and procedures to prevent, detect, and correct noncompliance with CMS's program requirements, as mandated by Federal regulations, were not always effective., We recommend that Humana refund to the Federal Government the $197.7 million of net overpayments and enhance its policies and procedures to prevent, detect, and correct noncompliance with Federal requirements for diagnosis codes that are used to calculate risk-adjusted payments., Humana disagreed with our findings and with both of our recommendations.  Humana provided additional medical record documentation which, Humana said, substantiated specific HCCs.  Humana also questioned our audit and statistical sampling methodologies and said that our report reflected misunderstandings of legal and regulatory requirements underlying the MA program.  After reviewing Humana's comments and the additional information that it provided, we revised the number of unvalidated HCCs for this final report.  We followed a reasonable audit methodology, properly executed our sampling methodology, and correctly applied applicable Federal requirements underlying the MA program.  We revised the amount in our first recommendation from $263.1 million (in our draft report) to $197.7 million but made no change to our second recommendation., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
263,OEI-03-15-00080,Increases in Reimbursement for Brand Name Drugs in Part D Report (OEI-03-15-00080) 06-04-2018,"Recent increases in prescription drug prices have drawn the attention of Congress, made headlines in major media outlets, and raised concerns in Government agencies that reimburse for these drugs.  Some studies also have shown that certain therapeutic classes of drugs-i.e., groups of drugs that treat specific conditions such as diabetes and heart disease-are becoming more expensive.  Drugs in these therapeutic classes are typically maintenance drugs, which means they are usually prescribed for chronic conditions.  Therefore, increasing costs for these drugs may have a long-term financial impact on Part D and its beneficiaries., This data brief examines how increases in reimbursement for brand name drugs in Part D may be affecting Medicare and its beneficiaries.  We used prescription drug event records, i.e., prescriptions, to provide an analysis of reimbursement amounts and utilization changes for brand name drugs in Part D from 2011 to 2015.  We also examined the impact of manufacturer rebates on total Part D reimbursement across the 5 years.  We compared the annual rate of inflation to changes in Part D unit costs for individual drugs with reimbursement in 2 consecutive years.  To control for the possibility that (1) increases in utilization or (2) newer, more expensive brand name drugs may have driven increases in total Part D reimbursement, we analyzed the number of prescriptions and average unit costs for brand name drugs that were reimbursed by Part D in every year from 2011 to 2015.  Finally, we evaluated beneficiary out of pocket costs for brand name drugs in Part D from 2011 to 2015., Our findings show that although there were fewer prescriptions for brand name drugs in 2015 than in 2011, increases in Part D unit costs for brand name drugs led to greater overall Medicare Part D spending and higher beneficiary out of pocket costs for these drugs.  Generally, plan sponsors base their reimbursement amounts on the prices that manufacturers set for their drugs.  Therefore, increasing manufacturer prices for brand-name drugs may result in increasing costs for Medicare and its beneficiaries, especially those beneficiaries who need access to expensive maintenance drugs."
264,A-05-17-00020,The Majority of Providers Reviewed Used Medicare Part D Eligibility Verification Transactions for Potentially Inappropriate Purposes A-05-17-00020 02-11-2020,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requested that OIG audit a mail-order pharmacy's Medicare Part D Eligibility Verification Transactions (E1 transactions).  To address CMS's request, we conducted this audit of E1 transactions, which included the requested provider's transactions.  During our audit, we discovered that providers were taking advantage of gaps in CMS's program integrity in E1 transactions.  Because E1 transactions contain beneficiary protected health information (PHI), we wanted to verify that the providers were appropriately using E1 transactions for their intended purposes., We judgmentally selected 30 providers that submitted 3.9 million E1 transactions.  We selected these 30 providers because they submitted a large volume of E1 transactions relative to the number of prescriptions processed.  We matched E1 transactions to prescriptions within 90 days of an E1 transaction.  The result was 2.6 million E1 transactions not matched to a prescription.  We reviewed supporting documentation to determine whether providers used E1 transactions for appropriate purposes., The majority of providers (25 of 30) used E1 transactions for some purpose other than to bill for a prescription or determine drug coverage billing order.  On average, 98 percent of these 25 providers' E1 transactions were not associated with a prescription.  We did not contact 10 providers because they were closed, under investigation, or both.  Fifteen providers submitted or hired other entities to submit E1 transactions for inappropriate purposes, which involved using a beneficiary's PHI. , After our audit period, CMS took additional steps to monitor use of the eligibility verification system and take appropriate enforcement action when abuse is identified., The deficiencies we identified occurred because CMS had not yet (1) fully implemented controls to monitor providers submitting a high number of E1 transactions relative to prescriptions processed until after our audit period, (2) published clear guidance that E1 transactions are not to be used for marketing purposes, and (3) limited non-pharmacy access., We recommend that CMS (1) continue to monitor providers submitting a high number of E1 transactions relative to prescriptions processed, (2) issue guidance that clearly states that E1 transactions should not be used for marketing purposes, (3) ensure that only pharmacies and other authorized entities submit E1 transactions, and (4) take appropriate enforcement action when abuse is identified., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions that it had taken or planned to take to address our recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
265,OEI-02-15-00440,Key Medicare Tools To Safeguard Against Pharmacy Fraud and Inappropriate Billing Do Not Apply to Part D OEI-02-15-00440 03-05-2020,"Medicare Part D paid $168 billion for drugs for 46.8 million Medicare beneficiaries in 2018.  Despite its size, Part D does not have the same protections against pharmacy fraud that other parts of Medicare have.  OIG has longstanding concerns about pharmacy-related fraud and inappropriate billing in Part D.  This issue brief is another step in OIG's larger strategy to fight this fraud and protect beneficiaries.  It focuses on the lack of three key tools to safeguard Part D: enrollment, revocation, and preclusion., To safeguard Medicare against fraud and inappropriate billing, it is crucial to keep out providers-including pharmacies-that pose risks to the program.  However, CMS's three key tools for doing so-enrollment, revocation, and preclusion-apply to pharmacies only when they bill Parts B or C, not when they bill Part D. , Pharmacies must enroll in Medicare to bill Part B, but they are not required to enroll to bill Part D.  Pharmacies that have their enrollment revoked for failing to meet Medicare requirements are still allowed to bill Part D.  CMS adds certain pharmacies that pose risks to Medicare to a Preclusion List.  CMS uses preclusion to prevent Part C from paying these pharmacies, but not to prevent Part D from paying them., If the powerful oversight tools of enrollment, revocation, and preclusion were available to Part D, CMS could take direct action against pharmacies that pose risks to the Medicare program or beneficiaries.  OIG views enrollment, with its screening process, as an extremely effective way to protect the Medicare program, including Part D.  We continue to recommend that CMS require pharmacies that bill Part D to enroll in the Medicare program.  This was an integral part of a previous recommendation that CMS has yet to implement.  We also recommend that CMS allow revocation of Medicare enrollment for inappropriate billing of Medicare Part D and include on the Preclusion List pharmacies that inappropriately bill Part D.  Lastly, we recommend that CMS apply the Preclusion List payment prohibition to pharmacies and other providers that dispense Part D drugs.  CMS concurred with all three of our new recommendations. "
266,OEI-05-17-00160,Part D Plans Generally Include Drugs Commonly Used by Dual Eligibles: 2017 Report  (OEI-05-17-00160) 07-06-2017,"This report fulfills for 2017 the annual reporting mandate from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) for 2017.  The ACA requires OIG to conduct a study of the extent to which formularies used by Medicare Part D plans include drugs commonly used by full benefit dual eligible individuals (i.e., individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits).  These individuals generally get drug coverage through Medicare Part D. Pursuant to the ACA, OIG must annually issue a report with recommendations as appropriate.  This is the seventh report the OIG has produced to meet this mandate., For this report, we determined whether the 369 unique formularies used by the 3,014 Part D plans operating in 2017 cover the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles.  We also determined the extent to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools to those commonly used drugs.  To create the list of the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles, we used the 2012 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey-the most recent data available at the time of our study.  Of the top 200 drugs, 197 are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage, 1 is excluded from coverage, and 1 is no longer prescribed in the form taken by beneficiaries.  One additional drug is eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage.  However, we did not include it in our analysis because we could not confidently project the use of this drug to the entire dual-eligible population. , Overall, we found that the rate of Part D plan formularies' inclusion of the 197 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles is high, with some variation.  On average, Part D plan formularies include 97 percent of the 197 commonly used drugs.  In addition, 70 percent of the commonly used drugs are included by all Part D plan formularies.  These results are largely unchanged from OIG's findings for formularies reported in the mandated annual report from 2016, as well as our findings from 2011 through 2015., We also found that the percentage of drugs to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools remained the same from 2016 to 2017.  On average, formularies applied utilization management tools to 28 percent of the unique drugs we reviewed in 2017, the same percentage as in 2016., Inclusion rates for the 197 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles are largely unchanged compared with the inclusion rates listed in our previous reports.  Part D formularies include roughly the same percentage of these commonly used drugs in 2017 as they did in 2016.  As mandated by the ACA, OIG will continue to monitor and produce annual reports on the extent to which Part D plan formularies cover drugs that dual eligibles commonly use.  In addition, OIG will continue to monitor Part D plan formularies' application of utilization management tools to these drugs.  OIG has no recommendations at this time."
267,A-07-16-06068,CMS's Enhanced Controls Did Not Always Prevent Terminated Drug Utilization in Medicare Part D Audit (A-07-16-06068) 11-27-2018,"The steps the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has taken to address terminated drug utilization in Medicare Part D were not entirely effective and, as a result, CMS continued to accept some prescription drug event (PDE) data for terminated drugs in calendar years (CYs) 2014 and 2015.  Although CMS has made improvements to prevent terminated drug utilization in Part D, it accepted PDE data totaling $31.9 million in gross drug costs for 3,705 terminated drugs in CYs 2014 and 2015.  CMS did not compare the information on termination dates in its quarterly Medicaid drug rebate files with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) file, did not investigate the discrepancies that existed between these two data sources, and did not update its system edits in a timely manner., We recommended that CMS continue to strengthen its internal controls to ensure that all PDE data for terminated drugs are rejected by working with FDA to verify the accuracy of drug termination dates, to include comparing the information on termination dates in its two data sources, investigating discrepancies between the data sources, and verifying termination dates with the manufacturers; and by updating its system edits with a new version of FDA's file on a more timely basis.  , CMS concurred with our second recommendation but not with our first recommendation, stating that although it remains committed to strengthening its internal controls to ensure that PDE data for terminated drugs are rejected, it regards FDA as the expert authority and source for national drug code listing information.  We maintain that our findings and recommendations remain valid, and we continue to assert that it is CMS's responsibility to use the information in the drug rebate files to identify differences between the two data sources., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
268,A-07-16-06067,CMS's Implementation of a 2014 Policy Change Resulted in Improvements in the Reporting of Coverage Gap Discounts Under Medicare Part D A-07-16-06067 01-21-2020,"The Coverage Gap Discount Program (CGDP) made manufacturer discounts equal to 50 percent of the negotiated price of applicable, covered Part D drugs available to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during calendar years (CYs) 2011 through 2018.  During CYs 2013 and 2014, Coverage Gap discounts totaled more than $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively., The size and complexity of the CGDP make the accuracy of the data it uses of paramount importance.  If the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) has not identified all Prescription Drug Event (PDE) records for which Coverage Gap discounts should have been invoiced, Medicare Part D beneficiaries may overpay for their prescription drugs at the point of sale., Our objective was to determine whether CMS ensured that Medicare Part D sponsors accurately reported all Coverage Gap discounts., We reviewed the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Comprehensive National Drug Code Structured Product Labeling Data Elements file (NSDE file) to identify applicable Part D drugs.  Using these applicable drugs, we examined the PDE data for CYs 2013 and 2014 to identify potentially missed Coverage Gap discounts that should have been reported., Although CMS generally ensured that Part D sponsors accurately reported Coverage Gap discounts, we identified instances in which sponsors should have reported these discounts but did not.  Specifically, for CYs 2013 and 2014, we identified $1.1 million in Coverage Gap discounts that should have been invoiced to manufacturers but were not because the discounts were not reflected in the PDE records submitted by sponsors.  This amount reflects (1) PDE records associated with drugs that, as Part D sponsors validated, should have had-but did not have-Coverage Gap discounts totaling $658,396 and (2) PDE records with an estimated $406,755 in missed Coverage Gap discounts that were still being reviewed by sponsors.  With respect to the PDE records associated with the $658,396 amount, Part D beneficiaries overpaid for their prescription drugs by $363,287 at the point of sale. , These discrepancies occurred because CMS did not always have the sponsor information it needed.  For that reason, CMS was not always able to accurately, and in a timely manner, identify beneficiaries who were in the Coverage Gap.  Effective January 1, 2014, CMS began to calculate Coverage Gap discounts for all Employer Group Waiver Plans (EGWPs) using the Defined Standard benefit.  (An EGWP is a group Medicare Part D prescription drug plan option that is offered to retirees who receive prescription drug coverage as part of their post-employment benefit package.)  This policy change enabled CMS to more easily identify PDEs that should have reflected Coverage Gap discounts.  After implementation of the policy change, EGWPs more accurately reported Coverage Gap discounts.  , We recommend that CMS (1) verify that Part D sponsors adjusted PDE records for $658,396 in validated Coverage Gap discounts and, of this amount, instruct the sponsors to remit $363,287 to the beneficiaries; and (2) research the remaining records for which we estimated missed Coverage Gap discounts totaling $406,755 and instruct Part D sponsors to validate and adjust PDE records accordingly and remit applicable amounts to the beneficiaries., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described the actions that it had taken or planned to take to address them., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
269,OEI-02-16-00440,Questionable Billing for Compounded Topical Drugs in Medicare Part D Report  (OEI-02-16-00440) 08-07-2018,"In 2016, OIG called attention to significant growth in spending for compounded drugs (customized medications tailored to meet the needs of individual patients).  Specifically, OIG found that Medicare Part D spending for compounded drugs grew by 625 percent from 2006 to 2015 and spending for topical compounded drugs-such as creams, gels, and ointments to relieve pain-grew at an even faster pace.  , At the same time, OIG has been involved in an increasing number of fraud cases related to compounded drugs-including topical drugs-in Medicare and other health insurance programs., There are also safety and effectiveness concerns related to compounded drugs, which are not FDA-approved.  The quality standards for compounded drugs are generally lower than for FDA-approved drugs, leading to increased risks such as production of products with the wrong potency. , We analyzed Prescription Drug Event (PDE) records for compounded topical drugs from 2010 to 2016.  With input from OIG investigators and CMS, we developed five measures to identify pharmacies with questionable billing for these drugs.  We also identified prescribers associated with these pharmacies., Medicare Part D spending for compounded topical drugs was 24 times higher in 2016 than it was in 2010.  This explosive growth raises concerns about fraud and abuse.  About 550 pharmacies had questionable Part D billing for compounded topical drugs in 2016.  These pharmacies warrant further scrutiny.  They each billed extremely high amounts for at least one of five measures that OIG has developed as indicators of possible fraud, waste, or abuse.  For example, many of these pharmacies billed for compounded topical drugs for a high proportion of their beneficiaries.  More than one-quarter of these pharmacies were located in four metropolitan areas.  In addition, 124 prescribers associated with pharmacies with questionable billing raise particular concern.  Each of these prescribers ordered high amounts of compounded topical drugs dispensed by these pharmacies., We recommend that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) clarify Part D policies for coverage of compounded topical drugs and use of utilization management tools.  Specifically, CMS should clarify that sponsors-the private companies that provide the Part D benefit-have the option to cover compounded topical drugs through an exceptions process.  CMS should also clarify that sponsors may apply utilization management tools to compounded topical drugs, even if individual ingredients would not be subject to such tools when dispensed individually.  CMS should also conduct additional analysis on compounded topical drugs and conduct training for Part D sponsors on fraud schemes and safety concerns.  Lastly, CMS should follow up on the pharmacies and prescribers identified in this review.  CMS concurred with all four of our recommendations."

Specifically, New York may have misallocated costs totaling nearly
                $19.6 million and claimed unallowable profit fees and other costs totaling nearly $3.8 million., This occurred because New York did not have written policies that explained how to properly allocate costs when it developed its original cost allocation plan. Further, New York did not establish a basis for the profit fee rate with its contractor,
                Maximus, Inc., at the beginning of the contract; did not require Maximus to always use its final cost rate for general and administrative costs; and did not require Maximus to retroactively adjust the calculation of its profit fee and
                general and administrative costs by removing project costs that should not have been subject to these charges., We recommended that New York (1) refund to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) $19.6 million that may have been misallocated to the establishment grants or work with CMS to determine the appropriate allocation to the grants,
                (2) refund to CMS $797,096 in unallowable profit fees or work with CMS to determine the appropriate amount that should have been claimed to the grants, (3) refund to CMS $32,083 in unallowable general and administrative costs and related
                profit fees, and (4) work with CMS to ensure that Maximus contract costs claimed after our audit period are properly allocated., In written comments on our draft report, New York generally disagreed with our recommendations. Specifically, New York stated that its method for allocating costs to the establishment grants was consistent with CMS-approved methodology and
                Federal guidance. New York also stated that the fact that different contract terms were negotiated for a subsequent period did not result in unallowable profit fees and general and administrative costs in prior periods., After reviewing New York's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid. New York's allocation formula included certain population groups (such as those enrolled in Medicare) that should not have been expected to use
                the New York marketplace's health insurance plan. Also, profit fees and other costs claimed were not allowable., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
                (CMS) operates the Federal marketplace and is responsible for reviewing, approving, and generating financial assistance payments (i.e., advance premium tax credits and advance cost-sharing reductions) for the Federal and State-based marketplaces.
                During the 2014 benefit year, CMS used an interim process for approving financial assistance payments. We previously reviewed CMSï¿½s internal controls under its interim process to ensure the accuracy of aggregate financial assistance payments
                and determined that the controls were not effective., The objective of this review was to determine whether CMS accurately authorized financial assistance payments in accordance with Federal requirements for policies associated with individuals enrolled in qualified health plans (QHPs) operating
                through the Federal marketplace., We found that of the 140 policies in our sample, CMS accurately authorized financial assistance payments for 109 policies; however, financial assistance payments for 26 policies were not accurately authorized in accordance with Federal requirements.
                For the remaining five policies, CMS authorized potentially improper financial assistance payments to QHP issuers that did not provide documentation to support that enrollees had paid their premiums, a requirement for receiving these payments.
                , On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that CMS authorized improper financial assistance payments totaling almost $434.4 million for 461,127 policies that were not in accordance with Federal requirements and authorized potentially
                improper financial assistance payments totaling almost $504.9 million for 183,983 policies during the 2014 benefit year. In 2016, CMS fully transitioned QHP issuers operating through the Federal marketplace to an automated payment system
                that makes financial assistance payments on an individual policy-level basis., We recommended that CMS (1) work with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and QHP issuers to collect improper financial assistance payments, which we estimate to be almost $434.4 million, for policies for which the payments were
                not authorized in accordance with Federal requirements; (2)ï¿½work with Treasury and QHP issuers to resolve the potentially improper financial assistance payments, which we estimate to be almost $504.9 million, for policies for which there
                was no documentation provided to verify enrollees had paid their premiums; and (3) clarify guidance with QHP issuers on Federal requirements for terminating an enrolleeï¿½s coverage when the enrollee fails to pay his or her monthly premium., CMS partially concurred with our first and second recommendations and concurred with our third recommendation. CMS stated that it will not require QHP issuers to return improper financial assistance payments for policies on which issuers acted
                in good faith, nor will it resolve potentially improper financial assistance payments for issuers that are out of business. CMS also provided documentation to support some payments to QHP issuers that we identified as improper in our draft

Specifically, we found that CMS (1) did not have a process in place to ensure
                that APTC payments were made only for enrollees who had paid their monthly premiums; instead, CMS relied on each QHP issuer to verify that enrollees paid their monthly premiums and to attest that APTC payment information that the issuer
                reported to CMS was accurate; and (2) had sole responsibility for ensuring that APTC payments were made only for enrollees who had paid their premiums and did not share these data for enrollees with the IRS when making payments., We determined that CMS's processes limited its ability to ensure that APTC payments made to QHP issuers were only for enrollees who had made their premium payments. Without processes for ensuring that APTC payments are made on behalf of enrollees
                who had paid their premiums, Federal funds may be at risk (e.g., there is a risk that funds were authorized for payment to QHP issuers in the incorrect amounts). , We recommended that CMS (1) establish policies and procedures to calculate APTC payments without relying solely on QHP issuers' attestations, including QHP issuer assurances, that enrollees have paid their premiums, and (2) once it implements
                an automated policy-based payment process to maintain individual enrollee data, consult with the IRS to explore sharing APTC payment data when these payments are made throughout the year in order to allow the IRS to verify the data reported
                on each individual's Form 1095-A at tax filing time.

                made., We determined that CMS's internal controls for calculating and authorizing financial assistance payments were not effective. Specifically, we found that CMS's reliance on issuer attestations did not ensure that advance cost-sharing reduction
                (CSR) payment rates identified as outliers were appropriate, CMS did not have systems in place to ensure that financial assistance payments were made on behalf of confirmed enrollees and in the correct amounts, CMS did not have systems
                in place for State marketplaces to submit enrollee eligibility data for financial assistance payments, and CMS did not always follow its guidance for calculating advance CSR payments and does not plan to perform a timely reconciliation
                of these payments., The internal control deficiencies that we identified limited CMS's ability to make accurate payments to qualified health plan (QHP) issuers. On the basis of our sample results, we concluded that CMS's system of internal controls could not
                ensure that CMS correctly made financial assistance payments during the period January through April 2014. Without effective internal controls for ensuring that financial assistance payments are calculated and applied correctly, a significant
                amount of Federal funds are at risk., We recommended that CMS correct these internal control deficiencies by requiring its Office of the Actuary to review and validate QHP issuers' actuarial support for index rates that CMS identifies as outliers, implementing computerized systems
                to maintain confirmed enrollee and payment information so that CMS does not have to rely on QHP issuers' attestations in calculating payments, implementing a computerized system so State marketplaces can submit enrollee eligibility data,
                following its guidance for calculating estimated advance CSR payments, and developing interim reconciliation procedures to address potentially inappropriate CSR payments., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our second, third, and fifth recommendations. CMS generally agreed with our first and fourth recommendations but indicated that the recommendations are no longer applicable because
                of regulatory action., After reviewing CMS's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid. CMS's regulatory action may appropriately address the findings related to our first and fourth recommendations. However, we have not tested the new
                advance CSR payment calculation described in the regulation. Therefore, we cannot determine if the new calculation methodology allows for the type of discrepancies we identified during our audit period., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
278,A-07-16-02804,Colorado Did Not Always Comply With Federal Requirements When Expending Federal Establishment Grant Funds Allocated for Its Shared Eligibility System Costs Audit (A-07-16-02804) 04-18-2018,"Connect for Health Colorado (Colorado marketplace), the health insurance exchange established by the State of Colorado under the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,  did not always comply with Federal requirements when expending Federal establishment grant funds allocated for the Shared Eligibility System (SES) costs.  (This audit focused on the allocation of SES costs to the Colorado marketplace by the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF), the State Medicaid agency, for the development and implementation of the SES, which is an automated system modified from HCPFs existing Medicaid eligibility system.)  Specifically, the Colorado marketplace allowed (1) SES costs to be allocated to it on the basis of an arbitrary, 50/50 cost allocation ratio, contrary to Federal requirements and to Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) supplemental guidance that the methodology for allocation be based on expected transactions and expected program population and not be arbitrary; and (2) SES costs totaling $2.1 million that were incurred, either entirely or in part, during the initial Cost Allocation Plan (CAP) period to be improperly allocated to it because the marketplace used the cost allocation ratio in effect for the revised CAP period. , SES costs were not always properly allocated to the Colorado marketplace because it did not have written policies that explained how to develop a CAP based on relative benefits received and because it did not maintain documentation for the cost allocation ratio.  In addition, the marketplace did not have adequate internal controls to ensure that these costs were properly allocated to it by HCPF using the cost allocation ratios in effect for the appropriate CAP period., We recommended that the Colorado marketplace develop and implement a cost allocation methodology and written policies, reinforced by adequate internal controls, that explain how to develop a CAP, how to provide formal input to HCPF and CMS during the development of cost allocation ratios, and how to adequately document the development of those ratios.  We also recommended that the Colorado marketplace develop and implement written policies and procedures to ensure that future Federal grant award costs are allocated to it in accordance with Federal requirements., The Colorado marketplace neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendations but described corrective actions that it had implemented or planned to implement to address those recommendations.  These comments dealt primarily with descriptions of the development of processes that the Colorado marketplace said it had undertaken with both HCPF and CMS for the allocation of costs.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
279,A-03-16-03001,The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Did Not Identify and Report Potential Antideficiency Act Violations for 12 Contracts Used To Establish the Federal Marketplace Under the Affordable Care Act A-03-16-03001 02-28-2020,"A 2008 HHS review of its acquisition process concluded that HHS components, including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), did not always obligate and expend funds in compliance with Federal requirements.  As a result, in July 2011, HHS reported a department-wide Antideficiency Act violation totaling more than $1.4 billion.  These previously identified deficiencies, combined with issues with the October 2013 launch of the Federal marketplace, raised concerns about CMS's management and oversight of contracts awarded in whole or in part for the support of the Federal marketplace.  CMS relies extensively on contractors to operate many of its healthcare programs, including the Federal marketplace.  , Our objective was to determine whether CMS obligated and expended funds for its Federal marketplace contracts in compliance with appropriations law and Federal requirements., We reviewed 74 contracts that CMS identified as having been awarded for the development, implementation, and operation of the Federal marketplace.  We reviewed these contracts to identify their funding sources and determine whether their obligations and expenditures from March 23, 2010, through October 31, 2015, were made in accordance with funding source and other legal requirements., CMS correctly obligated and expended funds for 62 of the 74 contracts we reviewed.  For the remaining 12 contracts, CMS did not obligate and expend funds in compliance with applicable laws and requirements.  For instance, CMS did not always obligate funds in accordance with the bona fide needs rule.  Under this rule, a fiscal year appropriation may be obligated only to meet a bona fide, or legitimate, need arising in, or in some cases arising before but continuing to exist in, the appropriation's period of availability.  CMS did not meet this rule because it obligated the wrong fiscal year's funds to contract modifications.  In addition, CMS did not meet rules governing expenditures because it paid some contract invoices with fiscal year funds that were not available at the time the billed work was performed.  CMS's accounting system, the Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS), did not ensure that expenditures were matched to obligations with an appropriate period of availability. , These errors resulted in potential, unreported Antideficiency Act obligation violations totaling $164.6 million ($155.9 million related to the Federal marketplace) and expenditure violations totaling $22.4 million ($18.3 million related to the Federal marketplace).  In addition, for three contracts, CMS failed to record obligations totaling $2.9 million in a timely manner.  Failure to record obligations in a timely manner can result in Antideficiency Act violations., We recommend that CMS (1) correct the bona fide needs obligation violations totaling $164.6 million ($155.9 million related to the Federal marketplace) and, if CMS is unable to correct those violations, report the Antideficiency Act violations; (2) correct the bona fide needs expenditure violations totaling $22.4 million ($18.3 million related to the Federal marketplace) and, if CMS is unable to correct those violations, report the Antideficiency Act violations; (3) coordinate with HHS, in consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, to develop guidance and train Office of Financial Management personnel on the correct process to record obligations and expenditures to avoid potential Antideficiency Act violations; and (4) develop automated controls in HIGLAS to ensure that contract expenditures for each program year are paid using appropriate program-year obligations., In written comments on our draft report, CMS did not specifically concur with our recommendations but described the actions it planned to take in response to those recommendations.  CMS stated that in coordination with appropriate offices within HHS, they would examine the identified obligation and expenditure violations, make appropriate account adjustments and report any resulting reportable Antideficiency Act violations as necessary.  Further CMS stated that in coordination with appropriate offices within HHS, they would develop additional guidance and provide training to personnel as appropriate once the contract obligation and expenditure violations identified by the OIG were examined.   In response to the OIG's final recommendation, CMS stated that automated controls would be developed in HIGLAS as appropriate. , After receiving CMS's comments on our draft report, we made two revisions to the total value of the bona fide needs obligation violations.  Our findings and recommendations, however, remain essentially unchanged., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
280,OEI-01-17-00090,"Most Hospitals Obtain Compounded Drugs From Outsourcing Facilities, Which Must Meet FDA Quality Standards  (OEI-01-17-00090) 06-06-2019","To provide FDA with insights to improve its oversight of compounders and enhance patient safety, OIG determined the extent to which hospitals purchase non-patient-specific compounded drugs from outsourcing facilities. , In response to deaths from an outbreak of fungal meningitis caused by contaminated compounded injections, Congress passed the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) in November of 2013.  This legislation enhanced FDA's authority over facilities that perform large-scale compounding of non-patient-specific drugs.  It distinguished these facilities, called outsourcing facilities, from traditional pharmaceutical compounding.  It allows compounders that are registered with FDA as outsourcing facilities to compound and distribute drugs without a patient-specific prescription., We selected a stratified random sample of 601 Medicare-participating hospitals and sent them a questionnaire, achieving an overall 94 percent response rate.  We asked detailed questions about where they obtain NPS compounded drugs and the factors they considered in choosing where to obtain them.  We determined the registration status of the compounders the hospitals identified by comparing the facilities' names to FDA's list of outsourcing facilities as of January 2018., Most hospitals that obtained non-patient-specific compounded drugs from outside compounders obtained them from compounders registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), known as outsourcing facilities.  Factors associated with quality, including registration with FDA as an outsourcing facility, are among the most important factors considered when hospitals decide where to obtain their non-patient-specific compounded drugs.  Few hospitals consider registering their own pharmacies as outsourcing facilities. , In light of our findings, we recommend that FDA further communicate with hospitals about the importance of obtaining their NPS compounded drugs from outsourcing facilities.  We also recommend that it take appropriate followup actions with a list of unregistered compounding facilities that we identified from our survey of hospitals and provided to FDA.  FDA concurred with our recommendations. "
281,OEI-09-16-00220,FDA Should Further Integrate Its Review of Cybersecurity Into the Premarket Review Process for Medical Devices Report  (OEI-09-16-00220) 09-10-2018,"Cybersecurity is an area with increasing risk to patients and the health care industry as more medical devices use wireless, Internet, and network connectivity.  Researchers have shown that networked medical devices cleared or approved by FDA can be susceptible to cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware and unauthorized remote access, if the devices lack adequate security controls.  These networked medical devices include hospital-room infusion pumps, diagnostic imaging equipment, and pacemakers. , FDA has emphasized that cybersecurity for medical devices is a responsibility shared among device manufacturers, health care providers, consumers, and FDA itself.  Manufacturers design networked medical devices that can include security controls to mitigate the cybersecurity risks.  They then seek FDA clearance or approval of their devices.  As the Federal agency responsible for regulating these devices, FDA may consider the cybersecurity risks and controls in its overall assessment of a device's safety and effectiveness.  Ultimately, FDA determines whether a networked medical device may be legally marketed in the United States. , To examine FDA's review of cybersecurity in premarket submissions for networked medical devices, we interviewed FDA staff who carry out and manage the reviews and interviewed members of the FDA's Cybersecurity Workgroup.  We examined a nonrepresentative sample of 22 submissions and FDA reviewer notes for networked medical devices that FDA cleared or approved in 2016.  We reviewed FDA policies, procedures, and guidance documents related to its medical device review process and to cybersecurity., To help assure the public that networked medical devices are safe and effective and that manufacturers are safeguarding their devices from potential cybersecurity threats, FDA reviews the cybersecurity documentation in premarket submissions that manufacturers submit to FDA before the devices can be marketed.  FDA uses its 2014 guidance on the content of premarket submissions and cybersecurity as general principles to assist its review.  FDA reviewers explained to us that they consider known cybersecurity risks and threats when reviewing submissions and apply that knowledge to networked medical devices that display similar risk profiles.  For example, if FDA identifies a cybersecurity threat to a certain cardiac device from a specific manufacturer, it considers that same threat in evaluating submissions for similar cardiac devices from other manufacturers., FDA reviewers look for cybersecurity documentation in the submissions.  Such documentation may include a hazard analysis or a matrix that describes the device's cybersecurity risks, controls to mitigate those risks, and threats that the manufacturer considered.  FDA reviewers often request additional information from manufacturers when submissions lack sufficient cybersecurity documentation or when clarification is needed.  At the time of our review, FDA had almost always cleared or approved the cybersecurity aspect of networked medical devices because manufacturers had been able to respond with supplemental cybersecurity information that FDA deemed sufficient.  FDA staff told us that manufacturers could use presubmission meetings to better understand what cybersecurity information FDA needs and the steps that manufacturers need to take as they design their devices., FDA could further integrate cybersecurity into its overall review process.  FDA's ""Refuse-To-Accept"" checklists, which the agency uses to screen submissions for completeness, do not include checks for cybersecurity information.  Also, FDA's ""Smart"" template, which FDA uses to guide its reviews of submissions, does not prompt FDA reviewers with specific cybersecurity questions that they should consider and also lacked a dedicated section for recording the results of the cybersecurity review., We recommend that FDA promote the use of presubmission meetings to address cybersecurity-related questions, include cybersecurity documentation as a criterion in FDA's Refuse-To-Accept checklists, and include cybersecurity as an element in the Smart template.  FDA concurred with all three recommendations."

In 2009, Congress passed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, authorizing FDA to begin regulating tobacco products in the United States.  It granted FDA comprehensive authority over domestic tobacco products and established the Center for Tobacco Products at FDA to oversee the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of these products.  Our work focuses on FDA's efforts to regulate and oversee domestic tobacco manufacturing establishments in the early years of implementing the Tobacco Control Act., This data brief presents descriptive information about tobacco establishment registration and product listing, as well as FDA's inspections and enforcement actions related to tobacco manufacturing establishments, covering 2010 to 2015.  We based this data brief on four data sources: (1) FDA Unified Registration and Listing System data from calendar years 2010 through 2015; (2) data on inspections of tobacco establishments from fiscal years 2011 through 2015; (3) enforcement action data from inspections and surveillance of tobacco marketing activity from fiscal years 2011 through 2015; (4) interviews with FDA officials.  , In the first 6 years FDA has been authorized to regulate tobacco, 171 tobacco establishments registered.  Tobacco establishments started registering with FDA slowly, and FDA acknowledged that the tobacco industry may have needed additional time to provide submissions.  Of the consumer products listed by registrants, cigarettes account for two-thirds followed by moist snuff and roll-your-own products.  FDA largely met its requirement to inspect tobacco manufacturing establishments biennially, and it concluded that no enforcement action was needed after those inspections.  In addition to inspections, FDA conducts routine surveillance of marking activities for tobacco products and issued 14 warning letters to manufacturers for violations of advertising and labeling requirements., Since the passage of the Tobacco Control Act, FDA has taken important steps in its oversight of tobacco products by implementing requirements for registration, listing, and inspection.  Given establishments' slow start in registration and missed annual renewals, it is important for FDA to ensure that all registrants update annually and provide full product list information.  Complete and accurate information on registrants will aid FDA in fulfilling its oversight role."
284,OEI-02-14-00420,Challenges Remain in FDA's Inspections of Domestic Food Facilities Report  (OEI-02-14-00420) 09-25-2017,"Each year roughly 48 million people in the United States get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases.  To protect against foodborne illnesses, FDA inspects food facilities to ensure both food safety and compliance with regulations.  Congress passed the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), which enabled FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than reacting to them after the fact.  FSMA requires FDA to inspect domestic food facilities within certain timeframes., We analyzed data from four sources: (1) information about facilities that FDA designated high risk and non-high risk pursuant to FSMA, and whether these facilities were inspected as required; (2) FDA's food facility inventory and inspection data from 2010 to 2015; (3) information about FDA's advisory and enforcement actions, such as warning letters and seizures, taken in response to significant inspection violations, as well as whether followup inspections were conducted for these violations, and; (4) structured interviews with FDA officials., FDA is on track to meet the domestic food facility inspection timeframes for the initial cycles mandated by FSMA; however, challenges remain as FSMA requires FDA to conduct future inspections in timeframes that are 2 years shorter than the timeframes for the initial cycles.  Also, inaccuracies in FDA's domestic food facility data result in FDA attempting to inspect numerous facilities that are either out of business or otherwise not in operation at the time of the visit. 
Although FDA is on track to meet the FSMA inspection mandates during the initial cycles, this did not result in a greater number of facilities being inspected.  In fact, the overall number of food facilities FDA inspected decreased over time.  In addition, FDA did not always take action when it uncovered significant inspection violations-those found during inspections classified as ""Official Action Indicated"" (OAI).  When it did take action, it commonly relied on facilities to voluntarily correct the violations.  Also, it rarely took advantage of the new administrative tools provided by FSMA.  Moreover, FDA's actions were not always timely nor did they always result in the correction of these violations.  Further, FDA consistently failed to conduct timely followup inspections to ensure that facilities corrected significant inspection violations. , We recommend that FDA (1) improve how it handles attempted inspections to ensure better use of resources, (2) take appropriate action against all facilities with significant inspection violations, (3) improve the timeliness of its actions so that facilities do not continue to operate under harmful conditions, and (4) conduct timely followup inspections to ensure that significant inspection violations are corrected.  FDA concurred with all four recommendations."

286,OEI-05-14-00470,HRSA Helped Health Centers With Elevated Risks and Can Continue To Take Additional Steps Report (OEI-05-14-00470) 05-25-2018,"The Health Center Program provides Federal funds to support health centers' operations with the goal of ensuring access to primary health care services for medically underserved populations.  HRSA is tasked with administering and overseeing the program, which serves 1 in 12 people in the United States.  Effective oversight of the program is essential to HRSA's ability to protect health center patients and Federal funds from the potential negative impacts of health centers that have elevated risks—i.e., health centers that are out of compliance with multiple program requirements or that are not financially stable., We analyzed HRSA data from 2013 through 2015 related to the 309 health centers that received Service Area Competition (SAC) grants for FY 2014.  We used HRSA's risk assessments to identify health centers with elevated risk.  For these health centers, we reviewed 2½ years of HRSA actions to help the health centers improve., Twenty-five percent of the health centers to which HRSA awarded SAC grants in FY 2014 had elevated programmatic or financial risks.  Included among these health centers were two that did not meet HRSA's funding criteria.  HRSA took steps to help health centers improve, and many health centers were able to do so.  However, HRSA missed opportunities to further help health centers because it did not use certain risk management interventions when it should have, exposing Federal funds to unnecessary risk.  In addition, HRSA was not always able to help health centers, particularly those with elevated financial risks, to improve before awarding them additional years of funding., During this study, OIG provided technical assistance to HRSA as it improved its oversight and worked to update its risk management process to implement new HHS guidance.  According to HRSA, it made changes in its risk management process based on this early information from OIG.  In this report, we provide two additional recommendations to help HRSA in its ongoing efforts to strengthen oversight of the Health Center Program.  Specifically, we recommend that HRSA (1) use risk management interventions in accordance with its policies to help health centers reduce elevated risks and (2) explore additional steps it could take to help health centers reduce elevated risks.  HRSA did not concur or nonconcur with our recommendations, but it noted actions it took that are responsive to them."

However, we found that 2 of Pennsylvaniaï¿½s 10 grant subrecipients
                did not properly account for MIECHV program funds. One subrecipient incorrectly claimed and received $131,591 in unallowable MIECHV program funds because it based its claim on a budgeted employee fringe benefit rate and not the actual
                rate. Pennsylvania repaid to the Federal Government $34,786 of that amount for FYs 2012 and 2013, and HRSA determined that the remaining $96,805 should be made available for use for Pennsylvania's MIECHV program provided that the funds
                were obligated by September 30, 2016, and liquidated by December 30, 2016. The second subrecipient claimed at least $252,399 of MIECHV program funds for expenditures that may not have been related to the program because it did not properly
                record MIECHV program expenditures in its general ledger., We recommended that Pennsylvania (1) determine whether the Erie County School District expended the $252,399 according to program requirements and refund to the Federal Government any amount not expended according to program requirements and

OIG and others have found significant problems in the quality of care and oversight of IHS hospitals.  This study identifies underlying organizational challenges that may hamper IHS's ability to address critical longstanding problems.  At times these issues have had serious consequences, including difficulty maintaining compliance with Federal quality-of-care requirements.  IHS has made important new plans for improving the quality of care that it provides in its hospitals.  However, if underlying organizational challenges are not addressed, they may prevent IHS from bringing its full organizational strength to these efforts., We based our findings on interviews with IHS officials and other stakeholders, and on our observations of agency practices while we were conducting this and other OIG studies.  Interview topics included challenges to the operations of IHS headquarters, Area Offices, and hospitals, and suggestions for accelerated progress.  We did not independently verify the substance of the statements provided to us in these interviews.  We also reviewed agency documents, including the Strategic Plan that IHS released in 2019.  We conducted qualitative analysis to identify organizational challenges to IHS agency management of its hospitals, and to develop strategies for improvement., OIG found three core organizational challenges that, if not addressed, could continue to limit IHS's ability to improve hospital operations and quality of care.  First, IHS lacks formal structure, policies, and roles.  IHS officials reported that they were often uncertain about their roles and those of other officials, including the authority to act in correcting problems.  Consequences included lack of accountability and undermining of quality of care.  The absence of clear roles was especially problematic with regard to the roles of IHS headquarters and Area Offices.  Second, IHS lacks awareness and insight about Area Office and hospital performance, and IHS's organizational culture does not always encourage candid discussion of problems.  Third, IHS officials lack confidence in the agency's ability to succeed.  IHS officials consistently expressed a deep commitment to and passion for the agency's mission and beneficiaries, but also often expressed doubt in the agency's ability to make sustained improvements. , To address the underlying organizational challenges identified in this report and to take steps to improve IHS operations, IHS should incorporate the strategies we outline as it implements its new plans to improve hospital quality and agency operations.  Specifically, IHS officials need to support an agency structure that outlines policies and roles; to cultivate a culture of continuous learning to support sustained improvements; and to inspire greater confidence in the agency's capacity to overcome longstanding challenges.  Additionally, in other evaluations OIG has recommended specific actions for improving quality in IHS hospitals, such as establishing a comprehensive compliance program focused on quality of care.  We continue to urge IHS to implement those recommendations."

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) funds studies that test substances, including BPA, for carcinogenicity and other harmful biological effects.  OIG received a congressional request to review the extent to which NIEHS funds research on the safety of BPA and the processes NIEHS used in planning and funding that research., We analyzed NIEHS BPA grants data for fiscal years (FYs) 2000-2015.  To determine whether NIEHS followed its peer review process, we analyzed and compared 101 BPA grants and 105 other, non BPA grants awarded during FYs 2010-2015.  For both sets of grants, we analyzed relevant funding announcements, summary statements, funding documents, and justifications for funding, if applicable.  Finally, we conducted interviews with staff from NIEHS, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about their BPA research and processes., Between FYs 2000 and 2015, NIEHS funding for BPA research increased significantly. NIEHS's BPA grants were concentrated among few institutions and researchers.  NIEHS used targeted announcements to fund about one-fifth of BPA and other grants.  NIEHS met basic requirements of its peer review process for all grants.  NIEHS used its discretion to fund 14 percent of BPA grants out of order as compared to 4 percent of other grants from FYs 2010-2015.  Finally, FDA and CDC have limited roles working with NIEHS on BPA research, although FDA contributed to the NIEHS-led Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity., NIEHS may prioritize its research, as it did with BPA.  NIEHS's peer review process is intended to ensure that applications submitted for funding are evaluated fairly, equitably, in a timely manner, and without bias, and NIEHS followed that process.  NIEHS's procedures also give it the discretion to fund applications with less favorable impact scores ahead of competing applications by justifying them in writing.  NIEHS used that discretion to fund 14 percent of BPA grants and 4 percent of other, non-BPA grants out of order.  Such discretion is allowed and enables NIEHS to be responsive to emerging threats to public health; however, applying it frequently or disproportionately in one research area may create an appearance of impropriety.

Included in that role is a charge to respond to international epidemics that could threaten the United States., When the Ebola crisis in West Africa began in December 2013, it overwhelmed the medical capacity of Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and the international emergency health response community-ultimately prompting the United States to expend efforts and resources to combat the biological threat.  Ultimately, Congress provided more than $5.4 billion in emergency funds for Ebola prevention and response, of which HHS received $2.76 billion., The objective of this review was to determine whether HHS's Ebola response efforts were effective and efficient., We reviewed each of HHS's components' preparation and coordination, both internally and with other components, related to the overall HHS Ebola response activities.  We obtained and reviewed applicable documents related to any needs and risk assessments that the components conducted during the planning and creation of its Ebola response plans.  Our review covered the period from the identification of the Ebola crisis in 2013 through the issuance of funds from the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act., As part of a global effort, HHS made significant contributions to controlling the Ebola crisis during 2014 and 2015 and was ultimately effective in accomplishing its mission to help stop the spread of Ebola.  However, HHS did not always efficiently plan and coordinate its international Ebola response efforts.  Specifically, HHS had no strategic framework in place to coordinate global health security at the international or departmental levels before the Ebola outbreak, HHS was not prepared to deploy the resources needed for such a large-scale international response, and HHS did not have in place internal or external communication channels for responding to an international public health emergency. , HHS's response efforts were further complicated by external factors.  Specifically, the World Health Organization did not declare the epidemic an emergency until well after the epidemic had significantly expanded in West Africa, and Congress did not provide supplemental funding until HHS's response was well underway., Without effective internal controls that include a department-wide strategic framework for responding to an international health crisis, HHS may continue to inefficiently plan and coordinate its international response efforts in future health crises., We recommend that HHS (1) develop department-wide objectives and a strategic framework for responding to international public health emergencies, (2) develop policies and procedures that clearly define HHS components' roles and responsibilities for responding to international public health emergencies, (3) develop large-scale international response plans, (4) develop various means of obtaining and using quality data for decision making, and (5) work with other U.S. Government agencies to develop a flexible multi-agency international response framework., In response to our draft report, HHS concurred with our recommendations and discussed actions that it would take or had taken to address the recommendations.  For example, HHS stated that it would work across its components to establish a framework for responding to international public health responses., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/dept.asp"">General Departmental</a>"
314,A-03-16-00354,The Food and Drug Administration Generally Complied With Federal Requirements for the Preparation and Receipt of Select Agent Shipments Audit (A-03-16-00354) 06-26-2019,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is one of several Federal agencies that ship and receive select agents.  Select agents are biological agents or toxins that HHS and the Department of Agriculture have determined pose a threat to humans, animals, plants, or the environment.  In 2015, another Federal agency found that one of its facilities had inadvertently shipped live Bacillus anthracis, a select agent which causes the deadly disease anthrax, to 194 laboratories in the United States and other countries.  In response to these events, we initiated a review of the policies, procedures, and protocols FDA implemented to ensure the safe shipment of select agents to and from its laboratories., Our objective was to determine whether FDA has designed and put in place controls to ensure that select agent shipments are prepared and received in accordance with Federal regulations and related supporting laboratory guidance and instruction. , We reviewed eight select agent shipments either sent or received by one of FDA's 11 registered entities from October 1, 2013, through September 30, 2015.  We also requested documentation of all inactivated select agents shipped and received during the same period.  We reviewed relevant FDA policies, training documentation, and inactivations for compliance with Federal requirements and guidance. , Generally, FDA has designed and put in place controls to ensure that select agent shipments are prepared and received in accordance with Federal regulations and related supporting laboratory guidance and instruction.  However, 8 of FDA's 11 registered entities' security plans did not include certain procedures for notifying the Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) if a select agent shipment is not received within 48 hours after the expected delivery time or a select agent shipment receives damage to the extent that a select agent release may have occurred, and none of FDA's registered entities' security plans included certain procedures for notifying FSAP if an authorization for a select agent transfer expires or becomes void before the shipment is completed.  In addition, we found that FDA's registered entities did not always maintain required select agent training documentation and did not have sufficient policies to ensure compliance with all new requirements for shipping select agents that have undergone inactivation., We recommended that FDA update its registered entities' security plans to include procedures for notifying FSAP if a select agent (1) shipment is not received within 48 hours after the expected time of delivery, (2) package is received damaged to the extent that a release of the select agent may have occurred, (3) shipment will not be completed within 30 calendar days after transfer authorization issuance, or (4) transfer authorization becomes void because the facts supporting the authorization changed.  We also made recommendations regarding FDA's select agent training documentation and policies for shipping inactivated select agents., In written comments on our draft report, FDA concurred with our recommendations and stated that it has taken actions to implement them.  FDA indicated that it has developed a standardized template for the Select Agent Security Plan used by the Office of Regulatory Affairs and FDA Centers that participate in FSAP that addresses all of our recommendations.  FDA also stated that it has revised its policies to address all of the recommendations.  Finally, FDA provided technical comments on our draft report that we have addressed in this report as appropriate., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/fda.asp"">Food and Drug Administration</a>"
315,OEI-01-15-00350,"OHRP Generally Conducted Its Compliance Activities Independently, But Changes Would Strengthen Its Independence Report  (OEI-01-15-00350) 07-27-2017","<a href=""/newsroom/podcasts/reports.asp#ohrp2017"">Independence of the Office for Human Research Protections</a>, Kimberly Ruppert, team leader in the Office of Evaluations and Inspections in Boston, is interviewed by Katherine Harris, a public affairs specialist in Washington, DC. , Protecting the rights of human subjects-individuals who volunteer to participate in research-is critical to ensuring their safety and public confidence in research conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  OHRP enforces compliance with HHS regulations for protecting human subjects.  Congress and others have raised questions about OHRP's independence, and Congress requested that OIG review OHRP procedures and make recommendations to strengthen protections for human subjects and ensure OHRP's independence., We analyzed data on OHRP's compliance activities for 2010 through 2015.  We did a survey of research institutions that were the primary subjects of OHRP compliance evaluations about their experiences with OHRP.  We also reviewed documents from eight compliance evaluations that had been closed.  Finally, we interviewed OHRP staff, other HHS officials, and individuals with expertise in protections for human subjects. , OHRP appeared to carry out its compliance activities for protecting human subjects while maintaining its independence from the HHS agencies that fund the research and the institutions conducting the research.  OHRP decided how to use its resources and, over time, initiated fewer compliance evaluations while increasing its use of other mechanisms in response to allegations.  OHRP determined the scope of its evaluations and what methods to employ.  Furthermore, OHRP was able-with some delays-to access the information it needed to conduct its compliance evaluations.  Lastly, OHRP maintained its determinations.  However, certain factors-varying interpretations of OHRP's role, its placement within HHS, and the way its budget is set- may limit or appear to limit OHRP's ability to act independently.  In addition, OHRP's practice of not reporting publicly on all of its compliance activities may give the appearance of limited oversight and independence. , We recommend that HHS address factors that may limit OHRP's ability to operate independently.  To accomplish this, HHS could (1) issue guidance that clarifies OHRP's role, (2) evaluate OHRP's position within HHS, and (3) evaluate the sufficiency of OHRP's resources and consider ways to elevate the prominence of its budget, such as including OHRP's budget as a line item in the President's budget.  HHS should also foster a shared understanding for OHRP's independence by considering seeking statutory authority for OHRP's independence.  We also recommend that OHRP post the following on its website:  (a) a description of its approach to oversight and (b) data (in aggregate) regarding its compliance activities. "
316,OEI-01-15-00351,OHRP Should Inform Potential Complainants of How They Can Seek Whistleblower Protections (OEI-01-15-00351) 09-18-2017,"OHRP receives and responds to alleged violations of protections for human subjects in research conducted or supported by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Employees of research institutions (e.g., researchers or study coordinators) with insider knowledge of the circumstances can help identify noncompliance in human subjects research earlier than other complainants or OHRP oversight activities.  Such information allows OHRP to address any noncompliance, hold institutions accountable, minimize risk to human subject volunteers, and ensure public confidence in federally funded research.  However, when employees are considering whether to disclose information about potential noncompliance, they may fear reprisal, such as demotion, suspension, or termination.  Under certain circumstances, employees at research institutions with HHS-funded grants or contracts may be entitled to relief commonly called ""whistleblower protections.""  Such protections may be available if an HHS contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee takes a prohibited employment action (e.g., termination) against an employee for making a ""protected disclosure.""  For complainants who fear reprisal, information regarding whistleblower protections may encourage disclosures of noncompliance., We analyzed data on OHRP's compliance activities for 2000 through 2015.  We reviewed OHRP's administrative files from eight closed compliance evaluations and an open incident report.  Five of the eight compliance evaluations we reviewed were for-cause evaluations and included documentation of the complaint reported to OHRP.  If the complainant requested whistleblower protections or reported concerns of retaliation that could adversely impact his or her career, we considered that to be evidence of fear of reprisal.  Finally, we conducted interviews with OHRP staff, HHS officials outside of OHRP, and individuals with expertise in protections for human subjects., OHRP reported that it often gets requests from complainants for whistleblower protections and that some complainants have chosen not to report suspected noncompliance to OHRP because it does not have the statutory authority to offer such protections.  In addition, of the five closed OHRP compliance evaluations we reviewed that were prompted by complaints, four had evidence of a fear of reprisal., We recommend that OHRP inform complainants of how they can potentially obtain whistleblower protections by reporting their allegations of noncompliance with human subject protections to entities such as OIG or the HHS agency that funds the research.  OHRP should post this information prominently on its website and include it in routine outreach to research institutions.  We also recommend that OHRP request that HHS consider the adequacy of whistleblower protections for complainants who make disclosures to OHRP about human subjects protections.  Elevating this issue would prompt HHS to consider whether a broad review of whistleblower protections is appropriate and whether it should seek a legislative change that enables OHRP and other HHS entities to receive protected disclosures.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health concurred with our recommendations."

This data brief is part of a larger strategy by the OIG to fight the opioid crisis and address one of its top priority outcomes-to protect beneficiaries from prescription drug abuse.  It provides baseline data on the extent to which beneficiaries receive extreme amounts of opioids and appear to be ""doctor shopping.""  It also identifies prescribers who have questionable opioid prescribing patterns.  , We based this data brief on an analysis of prescription drug event records of opioids received in 2016.  We determined beneficiaries' morphine equivalent dose (MED), which is a measure that equates all of the various opioids and strengths into one standard value. , Ensuring the appropriate use and prescribing of opioids is essential to protecting the health and safety of beneficiaries and the integrity of Part D.  Prescribers play a key role in combatting opioid misuse.  They must be given the information and tools needed to appropriately prescribe opioids when medically necessary.  At the same time, we must address prescribers with questionable prescribing patterns for opioids to ensure that Medicare Part D is not paying for unnecessary drugs that are being diverted for resale or recreational use.  OIG is committed to continuing investigations and evaluations to address this issue.  , In addition, we are committed to forging expanded partnerships among Federal agencies, States, and private sector partners.  We specifically call on Part D sponsors to work with OIG and CMS to further improve efforts to combat opioid misuse in Medicare.  We also encourage Part D sponsors to effectively use CMS's Overutilization Monitoring System, which identifies beneficiaries who are potentially overutilizing opioids.  We further encourage sponsors to implement drug management programs for at-risk beneficiaries, following additional guidance from CMS.  By working together and expanding our efforts in Part D, we can help curb the opioid crisis in our Nation. "

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) couples medication (such as buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone) with counseling and behavioral therapies to treat opioid use disorder.  Since 2000, Congress has enacted several measures to increase the availability of MAT, including the creation and expansion of the Buprenorphine Waiver Program (waiver program).  The waiver program allows physicians and certain other qualified providers to prescribe buprenorphine to patients in office settings rather than limiting this service to specialized opioid treatment programs.  Despite these efforts, studies still show that only a small percentage of Americans who need treatment actually receive it., OIG used data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to determine the number and nation-wide patient capacity of providers who had received waivers to prescribe buprenorphine for MAT as of April 2018.  We also used these data to identify U.S. counties with low patient capacity rates.  We used three public health data sources to identify counties with high indicators of opioid misuse and abuse (i.e., counties with high need).  We then examined the patient capacity rates for these high-need counties and identified those with low to no capacity to provide buprenorphine services., The number of providers who have obtained waivers through SAMHSA's waiver program has increased significantly since 2002, with close to 47,000 permitted to prescribe the drug in the office setting as part of MAT as of April 2018.  However, this figure likely overstates the availability of buprenorphine treatment in these settings, as (1) studies show that many waivered providers do not treat up to their approved patient-limit capacity (i.e., up to 30, 100, or 275 patients), and (2) our analysis indicates that access to buprenorphine services through waivered providers is not distributed evenly across the nation.  Specifically, 40 percent of counties in the U.S. did not have a single waivered provider in 2018.  Even more concerning, waivered providers were not necessarily found in the areas where access to MAT is most critical.  Among the approximately 1,100 counties identified by OIG as having the greatest need for buprenorphine services, 56 percent likely had inadequate capacity to treat patients with buprenorphine in an office setting.  , We recommend that SAMHSA geographically target its efforts to increase the participation of waivered providers in high-need counties.  SAMHSA concurred with our recommendation. "
321,OEI-12-17-00260,Excluding Noncovered Versions When Setting Payment for Two Part B Drugs Would Have Resulted in Lower Drug Costs for Medicare and its Beneficiaries Report  (OEI-12-17-00260) 11-21-2017,"A limited number of prescription drugs—generally those that are injected or infused in physicians' offices or hospital outpatient settings—are covered under Medicare Part B.  With certain exceptions, Part B does not cover drugs that are self-administered by patients, including drugs administered by self-injection.  However, in a small number of cases, self-administered drugs that typically would be used in situations not covered under Part B are being included by CMS when setting payment amounts. , Using CMS's Part B drug files, data from national drug compendia, and information from manufacturer websites, we identified drugs with payment amounts based in part on self-administered versions that would not typically meet Part B coverage criteria.  For these drugs, we recalculated the Medicare payment amounts from 2014-2016 with the self-administered versions removed.  We calculated the difference between the actual and alternate payment amounts in each quarter.  To determine how much Medicare and its beneficiaries would have spent for each drug had CMS not included self-administered versions, we multiplied the alternate payment amount in each quarter by the total number of units reimbursed by Medicare Part B in that quarter.  We then subtracted the results from actual quarterly Part B expenditures for each drug to determine how much less Medicare and its beneficiaries would have spent., CMS and a Federal court interpret the law to require the inclusion of noncovered versions of drugs in limited circumstances when setting payment amounts under Medicare Part B.  As a result, CMS included noncovered, self-administered versions when calculating payment amounts for two Part B drugs.  The inclusion of these noncovered versions caused Medicare and its beneficiaries to pay an extra $366 million from 2014 through 2016., We recommend that CMS seek a legislative change that would provide the agency flexibility to determine when noncovered versions of a drug should be included in Part B payment amount calculations.  CMS did not concur with our recommendation."
322,OEI-12-17-00350,Followup Review:  CMS's Management of the Quality Payment Program (OEI-12-17-00350) 12-13-2017,"The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) enacted clinician payment reforms designed to promote quality and value of care.  These reforms, known as the Quality Payment Program (QPP), are a significant shift in how Medicare calculates compensation for clinicians and require CMS to develop a complex system for measuring, reporting, and scoring the value and quality of care.  The first performance year began on January 1, 2017., In 2016, OIG conducted an early implementation review of CMS's management of the QPP.  While we found that CMS had made significant progress in developing the QPP, we identified two vulnerabilities that were critical for CMS to address in 2017:  (1) providing sufficient guidance and technical assistance to ensure that clinicians were ready to participate in the QPP, and (2) developing information technology (IT) systems to support data reporting, scoring, and payment adjustment.  OIG conducted this followup review to assess CMS's progress in mitigating these potential vulnerabilities and to identify emerging risks., We interviewed CMS staff and reviewed internal CMS documents as well as publicly available information.  We conducted qualitative analysis to identify key milestones (both those achieved and those yet to come), priorities, and challenges related to QPP implementation., During 2017, CMS made significant efforts to address the two vulnerabilities that OIG identified in its 2016 management review-developing IT systems and preparing clinicians to participate in the QPP.  With regard to IT, CMS appears on track to deploy the systems needed for data submission by January 1, 2018.  With regard to clinician readiness, CMS has conducted outreach, awarded technical assistance contracts, communicated eligibility information, issued subregulatory guidance, and established a Service Center to respond to questions.  However, clinician feedback collected by CMS demonstrates widespread awareness of the QPP, but also uncertainty about eligibility, data submission, and other key elements of the program.  With regard to emerging challenges, we found that CMS has not yet developed a comprehensive program integrity plan for the QPP., CMS has made progress towards implementing the QPP, but challenges remain.  CMS appears on track to deploy the IT systems needed for data submission by January 1, 2018.  OIG has identified two vulnerabilities that are critical for CMS to address in 2018 because of their potential impact on the program's success:, 
<ol>
<li>If clinicians do not receive sufficient technical assistance, they may struggle to succeed under the QPP or choose not to participate.</li>
<li>If CMS does not develop and implement a comprehensive program integrity plan for the QPP, the program will be at greater risk of fraud and improper payments.</li>

323,OEI-02-17-00020,Hospice Deficiencies Pose Risks to Medicare Beneficiaries Report  (OEI-02-17-00020) 07-03-2019,"<a href=""/newsroom/media-materials/2019/hospice"">2019: Vulnerabilities in Hospice Care</a>, The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has identified significant vulnerabilities in the Medicare hospice benefit and found that hospices did not always provide needed services to beneficiaries and sometimes provided poor quality care.  Hospice care can provide great comfort to beneficiaries, their families, and other caregivers at the end of a beneficiary's life.  To promote compliance and quality of care, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) relies on State agencies and accrediting organizations to survey hospices.  As part of this process, surveyors review clinical records, visit patients, and cite hospices with deficiencies when they do not meet Medicare requirements.  Hospices must be surveyed at least once every 3 years.  Surveyors also investigate complaints.  This report provides a first-time look at hospice deficiencies nation-wide in that it includes both hospices that were surveyed by State agencies and those surveyed by accrediting organizations.  This report is the first in a two-part series.  The companion report addresses beneficiary harm in depth. , We based this study on an analysis of CMS's deficiency and complaint data from 2012 through 2016.  We analyzed data from State agencies and accrediting organizations.  We also reviewed the survey reports from State agencies for a purposive sample of 50 serious deficiencies., Hospices are reviewed onsite by surveyors from either State agencies or accrediting organizations.  These surveys are key to ensuring quality care.  Surveyors cite the hospice with a deficiency if it fails to meet a requirement for participating in the Medicare program.  From 2012 through 2016, nearly all hospices that provided care to Medicare beneficiaries were surveyed.  Over 80 percent of these hospices had at least one deficiency., The most common types of deficiencies involve poor care planning, mismanagement of aide services, and inadequate assessments of beneficiaries.  In addition to these, hospices had other deficiencies that also posed risks to beneficiaries.  These failings-such as improperly vetting staff and inadequate quality control-can jeopardize beneficiaries' safety and lead to poor care.  In addition, one-third of all hospices that provided care to Medicare beneficiaries had complaints filed against them.  Over 300 hospices had at least one serious deficiency or at least one substantiated severe complaint in 2016, which we considered to be poor performers.  These hospices represent 18 percent of all hospices surveyed nation-wide in 2016.  Most poor performers had other deficiencies or substantiated complaints in the 5-year period.  Some poor performers had a history of serious deficiencies. , The findings provide further evidence that CMS should implement existing OIG recommendations to strengthen the survey process, establish additional enforcement remedies, and provide more information to beneficiaries and their caregivers. We also make several new recommendations.  CMS should: (1) expand the deficiency data that accrediting organizations report to CMS and use these data to strengthen its oversight of hospices; (2) take the steps necessary to seek statutory authority to include information from accrediting organizations on Hospice Compare, CMS's website that contains limited information about individual hospices; (3) include on Hospice Compare the survey reports from State agencies; (4) include on Hospice Compare the survey reports from accrediting organizations, once authority is obtained; (5) educate hospices about common deficiencies and those that pose particular risks to beneficiaries; and (6) increase oversight of hospices with a history of serious deficiencies.  CMS either concurred or partially concurred with all the recommendations except the third."
324,OEI-03-17-00310,The MEDIC Produced Some Positive Results but More Could be Done to Enhance its Effectiveness Report (OEI-03-17-00310),"The Medicare Drug Integrity Contractor (MEDIC) is CMS's benefit integrity contractor tasked with detecting and preventing fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare Part C and Part D.  These programs involve billions of dollars in expenditures and cover millions of beneficiaries.  Therefore, effective, proactive oversight is essential to protect Medicare and its beneficiaries from fraud, waste, and abuse.  OIG conducted this evaluation in response to a congressional mandate outlined in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 (CARA).  CARA requires OIG to conduct a study and submit a report on the effectiveness of the MEDIC's efforts to identify, combat, and prevent fraud in Medicare Part C and Part D.  , We analyzed Workload Statistic Reports related to the MEDIC's Part C and Part D benefit integrity activities from fiscal years 2012 through 2017 to determine how these activities have changed throughout the years.  In addition, we followed up with the MEDIC (Health Integrity, LLC, now Qlarant Integrity Solution, LLC) to ask about its barriers and challenges in performing these activities.  From the MEDIC, we also requested its results regarding the identification of high risk pharmacies and providers.  To gauge the MEDIC's financial effectiveness, we developed a return on investment measure comparing the amount paid to the MEDIC with actual recoveries reported by the MEDIC.  We reviewed information from CMS regarding the measures and data it uses to determine the MEDIC's overall effectiveness., While the MEDIC's reported recoveries resulted in a positive return on investment ($3 in recoveries for every $1 invested in 2017), CMS has no measures that specifically assess the MEDIC's effectiveness.  Without specific measures, it is unclear how CMS assesses the MEDIC's effectiveness in fighting fraud.  OIG's analysis of MEDIC activities and responses from MEDIC staff provided insights into MEDIC operations that could lead to both enhanced MEDIC effectiveness and improved measures to gauge this effectiveness.  , CMS directed the MEDIC to devote more resources to proactive data analysis and administrative actions in 2014 and 2015, which led to a sharp increase in proactive data analysis, but a decrease in the MEDIC resources available to follow up on the results of these analyses.  As a result, there have been fewer MEDIC investigations and referrals to law enforcement agencies, including OIG.  The direction did lead to an initial upswing in administrative actions (revocations and exclusions); however, those declined precipitously in 2017 due to other procedural changes.  Through its increased proactive analyses, the MEDIC was able to identify thousands of high-risk leads involving drugs, including opioids, from 2014 through 2017.  The impact of these activities, however, cannot be measured as plan sponsors are not required to report to CMS the actions taken in response to these leads. , In addition, MEDIC staff described numerous barriers that limit the MEDIC's overall impact.  These barriers include the MEDIC's lack of access to complete Part C encounter data; its inability to recommend certain administrative actions, such as revocation of billing privileges, against Part C and Part D providers and pharmacies not enrolled in Medicare; and its inability to obtain all requested medical records from pharmacies, providers, and pharmacy benefit managers., We recommend that CMS (1) require plan sponsors to report fraud and abuse incidents and the corrective actions taken to address them to a centralized system; (2) provide the MEDIC with centralized access to all Part C encounter data; (3) require that Part C and Part D providers and pharmacies enroll in Medicare; (4) clarify the MEDIC's authority to require records from pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, and other entities under contract with Part C and Part D plan sponsors; (5) ensure that the MEDIC has the ability to require medical records from prescribers of Part D drugs not under contract with plan sponsors, obtaining legislative authority, if necessary; and (6) establish measures to assess the MEDIC's effectiveness.  CMS did not concur with the third and fifth recommendations."
325,OEI-03-17-00040,CMS Ensured Nearly All Part D Drug Records Contained Valid Prescriber Identifiers in 2016 Report  (OEI-03-17-00040) 10-31-2017,"Prescriber identifiers are a valuable program integrity safeguard.  They enable CMS and Part D plan sponsors to determine if legitimate practitioners have prescribed drugs for enrollees.  Plan sponsors are required to include prescriber identifiers on the Part D prescription drug event (PDE) records they submit to CMS.  The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) requires that, beginning in 2016, pharmacy claims for covered Part D drugs must contain valid prescriber National Provider Identifiers (NPIs).  Additionally, the law requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish procedures for determining the validity of these prescriber NPIs.  The law also requires OIG to submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of these procedures no later than January 1, 2018.  This evaluation report fulfills OIG's MACRA mandate., We compared the prescriber NPIs on calendar year 2016 PDE records submitted to CMS for covered drugs to the NPIs in CMS's National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) file.  NPPES is the system of record for health care providers' NPIs.  We considered prescriber NPIs to be invalid if (1) they did not appear in the NPPES file, or (2) they appeared in the NPPES file but had been deactivated before January 1, 2015, and remained deactivated through 2016.  We reviewed CMS documentation and its responses to a questionnaire regarding its procedures to determine the validity of Part D prescriber NPIs. , Of the 1.5 billion PDE records that plan sponsors submitted to CMS for covered drugs in 2016, we found only 147 records that contained invalid prescriber identifiers.  These records represented $19,122 in Part D payments.  The 147 PDE records were associated with 70 invalid prescriber identifiers, which accounted for a small percentage (0.005) of the 1.4 million unique prescriber identifiers on the PDE records in our review.  Specifically, 1 invalid NPI was not listed in the NPPES file, and the remaining 69 invalid NPIs had been deactivated more than 1 year prior to the dates of service on associated PDE records., CMS has system edits in place to review PDE records to determine whether prescriber identifiers are valid NPIs.  These edits reject PDE records (1) that do not contain a prescriber identifier that is an NPI in CMS's current NPPES file and (2) where the date of service is more than 1 year after a prescriber NPI has been deactivated.  Regarding the one NPI that was not listed in the NPPES file noted above, CMS stated that this invalid identifier had bypassed its PDE system editing and that CMS is in the process of determining if its edit logic can be modified.  For the PDE records associated with the 69 deactivated prescriber NPIs noted above, the dates of service occurred during a time when the date-of-service edit was operating as an informational edit rather than a reject edit.  This suggests that CMS accepted these PDE records because the edit flagged-rather than rejected-these records.  This edit was changed to a reject edit in May 2016.  Additionally, CMS has provided plan sponsors with the procedures they should follow to ensure the validity of prescriber NPIs. , The system edits that CMS currently has in place to check PDE records are effective in ensuring the validity of the vast majority of Part D prescriber NPIs."
326,OEI-03-17-00120,One Percent of Drugs With Medicaid Reimbursement Were Not FDA-Approved Report (OEI-03-17-00120) 05-03-2019,"Exhibit: Nearly all drugs with Medicaid reimbursement were FDA-approved, Source: OIG analysis of Medicaid and FDA data, 2016., Previous OIG work found that Medicaid may have paid for drugs in 2008 that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as safe and effective.  To qualify for Federal payments under Medicaid, drugs must be FDA-approved unless they meet the criteria for an exception-for example, prescription prenatal vitamins or drugs that are prescribed during times of drug shortages., Congress asked OIG to examine CMS's oversight of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the extent to which CMS relies on the FDA's drug classifications., We obtained utilization data for drugs with Medicaid reimbursement in 2016.  We used the FDA marketing categories to determine whether drugs were FDA approved.  We calculated the number and percentage of (1) drugs that were FDA-approved, (2) drugs that were not FDA-approved, and (3) drugs for which we were unable to determine the FDA approval status.  We also determined the amounts that Medicaid reimbursed for each of these groups of drugs in 2016.  Finally, we reviewed CMS's policies and procedures for evaluating the FDA approval status of drugs in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. , Ninety-six percent of drugs with Medicaid reimbursement in 2016 were FDA approved for safety and effectiveness.  However, Medicaid reimbursed for a small percentage of drugs (1 percent, or 267 drugs) that were not FDA-approved.  For the remaining drugs, we were unable to determine an FDA approval status., In the time since our previous report, FDA has implemented our recommendation to improve the completeness and accuracy of its drug directory to ensure the directory's integrity for CMS and all other stakeholders.  These improvements have strengthened CMS's ability to verify the FDA approval status of drugs in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  Since 2014, CMS also has implemented additional oversight activities to verify the FDA approval status of drugs.  However, these improvements may not have prevented potentially inappropriate Medicaid reimbursement for a small number of drugs that were not FDA-approved., We recommend that CMS (1) work with States to recoup any potentially inappropriate Federal reimbursement for drugs that CMS determines were not FDA-approved and did not meet the criteria for an exception; (2) continue to improve its reporting system to prevent inappropriate reimbursement for drugs that are not FDA-approved, and (3) work with States to ensure that they prevent inappropriate reimbursement for drugs that are not FDA approved and do not meet the criteria for an exception.  CMS concurred with all three recommendations."
327,OEI-03-17-00100,Potential Misclassifications Reported by Drug Manufacturers May Have Led to $1 Billion in Lost Medicaid Rebates Report  (OEI-03-17-00100) 12-15-2017,"Manufacturers with rebate agreements are required to report all of their covered outpatient drugs to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (Medicaid rebate program).  CMS calculates rebate amounts using manufacturer reported pricing and classification data.  Congress asked OIG to evaluate the accuracy of manufacturer reported data in the Medicaid rebate program, and CMS's oversight of that data. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) marketing categories, which also are manufacturer reported, can be used to help determine whether a drug is classified as an innovator, e.g., brand name, or noninnovator, e.g., generic, product, for the purposes of calculating Medicaid rebates.  Innovator products are generally subject to higher base rebate amounts.  Manufacturers are required to pay an additional, inflation adjusted rebate if a drug's price increases faster than inflation.  When information provided by drug manufacturers is incorrect or missing, State Medicaid agencies may not be able to collect all appropriate rebates.  , We compared manufacturer reported classifications for drugs in the Medicaid rebate program to drug information in FDA files.  We determined the Medicaid drug classifications that matched FDA's, and those that did not match, i.e., were potentially misclassified, in 2016.  We then estimated the rebate amounts that Medicaid may have lost from 2012 to 2016 for the 10 potentially misclassified drugs with the highest total reimbursement in 2016.  Finally, we reviewed CMS's policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate oversight of data submitted to the Medicaid rebate program., The vast majority of the approximately 30,000 drugs in the Medicaid rebate program were classified appropriately.  However, we found that manufacturers may have misclassified 885 of these drugs (3 percent) in 2016.  We found that from 2012 to 2016, Medicaid may have lost $1.3 billion in base and inflation adjusted rebates for 10 potentially-misclassified drugs with the highest total reimbursement in 2016.  , When CMS determines that information reported by manufacturers may be incorrect, it requests that manufacturers change the data.  CMS does not have the explicit legal authority to require manufacturers to change their classification data.  CMS did report that when it identifies potential errors in classification data, it works with manufacturers to assist them in correcting the errors.  However, CMS does not track or maintain a central database of these potential errors or their resolutions.  Therefore, we had no way to determine which drugs CMS identified as potentially misclassified, or what steps, if any, CMS took to address these potential misclassifications., <p align=""center"" class=""b"">Manufacturers may have owed an additional $1.3 billion for <br>10 potentially-misclassified drugs with the highest total reimbursement in 2016</br>, <p align=""center""><img alt=""A graphic stating $1.3 billion in additional rebates that manufacturers may have owed if classified as innovator drugs vs $199 million rebates claimed"" src=""../images/oei-03-17-00100.jpg"" width=""500""/>, <p align=""center"">Source: OIG analysis of Medicaid and FDA drug classification data, 2016, We recommend that CMS (1) follow up with manufacturers associated with potentially misclassified drugs identified in this report to determine whether current classifications are correct, (2) improve its Drug Data Reporting for Medicaid System to minimize inconsistent data submissions and track potential classification errors for followup, and (3) pursue a means to compel manufacturers to correct inaccurate classification data reported to the Medicaid rebate program.  CMS concurred with all three recommendations."
328,OEI-12-17-00130,Reasonable Assumptions in Manufacturer Reporting of AMPs and Best Prices Report  (OEI-12-17-00130) 09-18-2019,"Ensuring the accuracy of manufacturer-reported average manufacturer prices (AMPs) and best prices (BPs) is vital given that these prices are the primary benchmarks that the Federal Government uses to calculate the rebates and discounts available to Medicaid and certain safety-net providers.  In the absence of guidance to the contrary, CMS allows manufacturers to make ""reasonable assumptions"" that are consistent with statute and regulation when they calculate the AMPs and BPs for Medicaid-covered drugs.  Previous OIG work has shown that manufacturers have made different assumptions when including or excluding certain sales in their price calculations, potentially leading to significantly lower or higher AMPs and BPs.  AMPs and BPs are used to calculate the amount of rebates that manufacturers must pay to Medicaid.  A lower AMP for example, could reduce the rebate amount that a manufacturer must pay, thus increasing net costs for Medicaid.  In addition, AMPs and BPs are also used to establish the prices paid by health care entities eligible for the 340B Drug Discount Program.  In September 2016, Congress asked OIG to examine CMS's oversight of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.  This report is the last of three OIG evaluations related to this request., OIG surveyed a sample of drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to identify the primary areas in which they make assumptions when calculating AMP and BP.  OIG also asked manufacturers to identify the areas in which they would like greater guidance or instruction from CMS on calculating AMP or BP.  We also interviewed and surveyed CMS officials regarding their processes for collecting and reviewing the assumptions that manufacturers make., Our findings show that the use of reasonable assumptions is common practice among responding manufacturers, and that nearly two-thirds reported wanting additional guidance from CMS on assumptions-related issues.  In our analysis of manufacturer responses, four areas stood out as warranting attention from CMS: oral specialty drugs; value based purchasing arrangements; bona fide service fees; and rebates to pharmacy benefits managers. , Historically, CMS has provided little formalized oversight of the reasonable assumptions process, specifically instructing manufacturers not to submit their reasonable assumptions to CMS.  The agency has stated that it has limited authority to assess manufacturers' assumptions, and that it does so only on a case-by-case basis to support formal oversight inquiries, manufacturer recalculations, and requests for technical assistance.  To that end, CMS has recently developed a process for specific manufacturer inquiries regarding calculations of AMP and BP.  , Manufacturers and OIG recognize that with hundreds of manufacturers, thousands of drugs, and a myriad of complex practices for pricing and sales, CMS is not in a position to review all assumptions on a regular basis.  However, given the far-reaching importance of AMPs and BPs, OIG believes that-with the goal of ensuring compliance and consistency in the industry-CMS could take additional steps to improve oversight in the area., We recommend that CMS (1) issue guidance related to specific areas identified in this report-specifically, value based purchasing agreements; (2) assess the costs and benefits of implementing a targeted process to review certain assumptions; and (3) implement a system to share responses to manufacturer inquiries for technical assistance.  CMS concurred with all three recommendations."

The Department of Health and Human Services publishes national quality measures that outline timeframes for followup care for children with ADHD.  Additionally, professional guidelines from American Academy of Pediatrics and American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry describe the importance of followup care and behavioral therapy for these children.  Some children may not receive followup care or behavioral therapy for reasons such as limited access to care or because practitioners may be unaware of the professional recommendations.  This study focuses specifically on the extent to which children do not receive followup care and behavioral therapy. , Children with ADHD have higher rates of repeating grade levels, dropping out of school, and receiving hospital care.  Childhood ADHD is also associated with negative outcomes in adulthood such as increased rates of other mental health problems, criminal behavior, and increased risk for suicide.  The annual societal costs of ADHD are estimated up to $266 billion from loss of productivity, as well as spending in the healthcare, justice, and educational systems.  , An estimated 13 percent of Medicaid-enrolled children are impacted by ADHD.  Treatment involving behavioral therapy, medication, and followup care can help improve these children's outcomes, long-term prognoses, and quality of life., OIG conducted this review in response to a congressional request to evaluate pharmaceutical and behavioral therapy treatment of Medicaid-enrolled children with ADHD. , We reviewed Medicaid claims data, fiscal years 2014 and 2015, from all States and the District of Columbia for Medicaid-enrolled children who received ADHD treatment.  We examined whether children received: (1) timely followup care with practitioners after being newly prescribed an ADHD medication, (2) timely followup care after ADHD hospitalizations, and (3) behavioral therapy in addition to ADHD medication.  We also interviewed professionals to understand the impact ADHD has on children., Over 500,000 Medicaid-enrolled children who were newly prescribed an ADHD medication and over 3,500 children hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of ADHD did not receive followup care within the timeframes outlined in the national quality measures.  Additionally, over 54,000 children did not receive any behavioral therapy as recommended by professional guidelines. , We recommend that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) work toward improving health outcomes by developing strategies to increase the number of children who receive timely followup care for ADHD.  Specifically, we recommend that CMS: , CMS concurred with all three of our recommendations."

In 2016, OIG found significant problems in the quality of care and oversight of IHS-operated hospitals.  Congressional testimonies in recent years and deficiency findings by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) also raised concerns about quality and patient access to care in IHS hospitals.  During a 3-year period, IHS temporarily closed the emergency department (ED) at 4 of its 24 hospitals.  The Rosebud Hospital ED remained closed for more than 7 months.  We conducted this study to examine IHS's management of the closure and reopening of the Rosebud Hospital ED to identify lessons learned that IHS could apply should similar situations arise in the future., This report provides a chronology of events and identifies factors that led to the closure of the Rosebud Hospital ED, improvement efforts to reopen the ED, and continued lapses in compliance.  We interviewed leadership and staff at IHS headquarters, the Great Plains Area Office, and Rosebud Hospital, and other stakeholders, including administrators at CMS, receiving hospitals, and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.  We also reviewed both internal and publicly available documents from IHS and stakeholders., After receiving citations during a CMS survey deemed of immediate jeopardy (IJ) to ED patients, IHS closed the Rosebud Hospital ED in December 2015.  IHS diverted Rosebud patients to the nearest hospitals but did not provide the hospitals or the emergency medical services (EMS) adequate time to prepare.  The receiving hospitals were overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of patients, and EMS struggled to meet demands with its limited staff and longer patient transports.  To correct Rosebud Hospital's deficiencies and re-open the ED, IHS provided additional resources and support from across IHS, sought assistance from other agencies, and entered into a Systems Improvement Agreement (SIA) with CMS.  IHS made improvements prompted by the SIA, which included updating policies and revising governing board bylaws.  IHS completed the SIA to CMS's satisfaction in September 2017, but CMS cited Rosebud Hospital again with ED-related IJ deficiencies in July 2018., To correct underlying problems and better serve its beneficiaries, we recommend that IHS, as a management priority, develop and implement a staffing program for recruiting, retaining, and training clinical and leadership staff in remote hospitals.  This is a necessary first step to addressing quality issues long term; however, other actions are also needed, including taking steps to ensure that IHS intervenes early and effectively when problems emerge.  To ensure better management of any future ED closures, we also recommend that IHS develop procedures for temporary ED closures and communicate those procedures with receiving hospitals and EMS to ensure that they are adequately prepared for such events.  IHS concurred with our recommendations"

                organizations that receive the majority of their Federal awards from HHS., In 2015, the HHS Office of lnspector General (OIG) determined that DFAS had a large backlog of unfinalized indirect cost rates that may have contributed to the untimely closeout of contracts totaling $25 billion at the Centers for Medicare
                &amp; Medicaid Services. In 2016, the Government Accountability Office identified weaknesses in the design of DFASï¿½s internal controls for establishing indirect cost rates., Our objective was to determine whether DFAS established final indirect cost rates for applicable organizations in accordance with Federal requirements. , Our audit covered 1,187 final indirect cost rate agreements that DFAS established for organizations during fiscal years 2012 through 2016. We selected a sample of 15 rate agreementsï¿½3 rate agreements for each year of the audit period; reviewed
                the DFAS case files containing the proposals and work papers associated with each sampled rate agreement; interviewed auditors and supervisors assigned to the proposals; and determined the extent to which DFAS complied with Federal requirements
                for reviewing, negotiating, and establishing final indirect cost rates., DFAS did not always establish final indirect cost rates for applicable organizations in accordance with Federal requirements during our audit period. DFAS had procedures to assess the allowability, allocability, and reasonableness of proposed
                indirect costs and identified unallowable costs that were excluded in its negotiations of rate agreements; however, DFAS did not always obtain adequate data demonstrating that (1) organizationsï¿½ proposed indirect costs were allowable,

As part of the standard, ACOs must report to CMS complete and accurate data on all quality measures.  For performance year (PY) 2017, ACOs were required to report data on 31 quality measures through 3 methods of submission: a patient survey, claims and administrative data, and the designated CMS web portal.  If ACOs do not report complete and accurate data, shared savings payments could be affected.  Previous OIG audits of two selected ACOs assessed whether they reported complete and accurate data on selected quality measures.  , Our objective was to determine whether CMS's monitoring activities were effective for ensuring that ACOs report complete and accurate data on quality measures., For PY 2017, we reviewed CMS's procedures and documentation.  We also reviewed the Statements of Work, which included specific monitoring tasks for CMS's contractors to perform on behalf of CMS.  In addition, we obtained information from the survey vendors on CMS's monitoring activities for the patient survey.  , CMS's monitoring activities were generally effective for ensuring that ACOs report complete and accurate data on quality measures through claims and administrative data and the CMS web portal.  (For example, ACOs report data through the web portal on whether beneficiaries received preventive care, such as depression screenings.)  However, we identified weaknesses in CMS's monitoring activities that could lead to ACOs reporting incomplete or inaccurate data through the patient survey.  Specifically, CMS did not ensure that its contractor: (1) verified survey vendors' correction of identified issues even though the issues were directly related to the collection or reporting of data and (2) provided feedback reports in time for survey vendors to include in their Quality Assurance Plans (QAPs) all of the changes implemented to address identified issues.  (A QAP describes a survey vendor's process for performing the patient survey and complying with the CMS Quality Assurance Guidelines.)  In addition, CMS did not ensure that its contractor reviewed survey instruments (e.g., mail survey packages) translated into other languages.  As a result of these weaknesses, ACOs may not report complete and accurate data on quality measures, which could affect the ACOs' overall quality performance scores and ultimately the shared savings payments., To improve its monitoring activities for ensuring that ACOs report complete and accurate data on quality measures, we recommend that CMS update the Statement of Work to require its contractor to: (1) verify that survey vendors have corrected identified issues that directly relate to the collection or reporting of data; (2) confirm that all implemented changes to address the identified issues are included in QAPs before they are approved; and (3) review the translated survey templates, mail survey packages, and telephone survey scripts to ensure that they are consistent with the English versions., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions that it had taken or planned to take to address our recommendations.  For each recommendation, CMS stated that it will review current contractor requirements and incorporate updates within the scope of the contract as needed to address the related finding., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Based on these results, we decided to review New York's consumer-directed personal assistance program (CDPAP) services,
                which include personal care, home health, and nursing services. New York's CDPAP permits chronically ill and physically disabled beneficiaries flexibility and freedom in choosing, training, and supervising their providers. New York claimed
                Federal Medicaid reimbursement totaling more than $579 million for CDPAP services provided from January 2012 through June 2016 (audit period)., Our objective was to determine whether New York claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for CDPAP services in accordance with applicable Federal and State requirements., We selected a statistical sample of 120 CDPAP claims for services provided during the audit period. We obtained and reviewed documentation to determine whether each selected claim was billed correctly. For 27 of 120 sampled claims, New York
                claimed Federal reimbursement for CDPAP services claims that did not meet Medicaid requirements. Specifically, New York did not provide documentation of services claimed, claimed reimbursement for services that were not authorized or supported,
                and claimed reimbursement for claims for which documentation was not completed in a timely manner. New York also claimed reimbursement for services provided after a 6-month authorization period had lapsed. This occurred because New York
                did not effectively monitor the CDPAP for compliance with certain CDPAP requirements., Based on our sample results, we estimated that New York improperly claimed at least $74.8 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement during our audit period. New York's lack of effective monitoring of the CDPAP leaves the program vulnerable
                to misuse of Federal funds and could potentially place beneficiaries at risk of harm., We recommended that New York refund $74.8 million to the Federal Government, reinforce guidance related to CDPAP documentation and billing requirements, and improve its monitoring of the CDPAP to ensure compliance with CDPAP requirements., In written comments on our draft report, New York did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations (though it did disagree with our findings related to 24 sample claims); however, it described the actions it was taking
                or planned to take in response to each of our recommendations. Specifically, New York provided a list of policies and guidance materials issued during our audit period related to CDPAP compliance and requirements and stated that it continues
                to provide guidance on an as-needed basis through routine audits of local social services districts. Under separate cover, New York provided documentation for 39 of the 43 sample claims questioned in our draft report. After reviewing New

Minnesota operates the program under a Federal waiver to its Medicaid State plan.  We have conducted health and safety reviews of Head Start grantees and of regulated childcare facilities and wanted to determine whether there may be similar health and safety risks for vulnerable adults living in homes., Our objective was to determine whether Minnesota complied with Federal waiver and State requirements in overseeing homes that serve vulnerable adults who receive services through the program., Of the 131 homes in Minnesota where vulnerable adults who receive services through the program resided for the quarter ended March 2016, we selected 20 homes for our review.  We selected the homes on the basis of their geographic location and history of health and safety-related violations identified by the State.  We conducted unannounced site visits from June 21 through August 18, 2016.  , Minnesota did not comply with Federal waiver and State requirements in overseeing homes that serve vulnerable adults who receive services through the program.  We determined that 18 of the 20 homes we reviewed did not comply with 1 or more State licensing requirements.  Specifically, we found 64 instances of noncompliance related to health and safety and administrative requirements.  , County licensor supervisors stated that instances of noncompliance occurred mainly because of low staffing levels and a lack of training opportunities for license holders (providers) and county licensors.  Additionally, specific State licensing requirements on the necessity of safeguarding hazardous materials were unclear., We recommended that Minnesota ensure that the 64 instances of noncompliance with health and safety and administrative requirements identified in this report are corrected, work with counties to ensure the health and safety of vulnerable adults by considering staffing standards and caseload thresholds for county agencies, review training opportunities available to providers and county licensors and improve or increase them as needed, and ensure that Minnesota guidance accurately reflects administrative requirements related to hazardous materials., Minnesota partially concurred with our first and second recommendations and concurred with our third and fourth recommendations.  Minnesota also outlined its plans for corrective actions, which include updating State guidance and developing training materials and licensor training specific to home safety., In response to Minnesota's comments, we maintain that all of our findings and the associated recommendations are valid and that in four of the six instances of noncompliance involving kitchen knives we reviewed, homes had at least one vulnerable adult residing who either had a history of physical aggression towards others or had a medical condition (i.e., dementia) that could pose a potential danger to self or others when kitchen knives are readily accessible., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) generally concurred with recommendations in these reports and implemented them.  However, our analysis of recent claim data indicated that overpayments for ambulance transportation might still be occurring., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare made Part B payments to ambulance suppliers for transportation services that were also included in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs as part of consolidated billing requirements., We selected a stratified random sample of 100 beneficiary days. Each beneficiary day contained all ambulance claim line items for a given beneficiary having the same date of service.  These line items were paid nationwide by Medicare Part B with dates of service from July 1, 2014, to 
June 30, 2016, for services provided to beneficiaries in Part A SNF stays.  , Medicare made Part B payments to ambulance suppliers for transportation services that were also included in Medicare Part A payments to SNFs as part of consolidated billing requirements.  For 78 of the 100 beneficiary days we sampled, Medicare made Part B payments that were incorrect.  Medicare overpaid the ambulance suppliers because the Common Working File (CWF) edits were not designed to prevent or detect Part B overpayments for all transportation subject to consolidated billing.  In addition, ambulance suppliers did not have the necessary controls to prevent incorrect billing to Medicare Part B., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Medicare made a total of $19.9 million in Part B overpayments to ambulance suppliers for transportation services for beneficiaries in Part A SNF stays.  In addition, we estimated that beneficiaries incurred an estimated $5.2 million in coinsurance and deductible liabilities related to these incorrect payments. , We recommended that CMS redesign the CWF edits to prevent Part B overpayments to ambulance suppliers for transportation services provided to beneficiaries in Part A SNF stays.  We also recommended that CMS direct the Medicare contractors to recover the incorrectly billed claims related to 78 sampled beneficiary days; notify the ambulance suppliers responsible for potential overpayments estimated at $19.9 million; and educate ambulance suppliers on Medicare Part B billing requirements, among other recommendations. , CMS concurred with our recommendations and described the actions that it has taken or planned to take to address them."

On the basis of these audits, we initiated an audit of similar mental health services provided under New Jersey's Programs of Assertive Community Treatment (PACT)., Under its PACT program, New Jersey offers community-based, intensive, comprehensive, integrated mental health rehabilitation services through a multidisciplinary team of professionals (known as a PACT team) to Medicaid beneficiaries with serious and persistent mental illness. , Our objective was to determine whether New Jersey's claims for Federal Medicaid reimbursement of payments for PACT services complied with Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered $69.3 million ($36 million Federal share) in claims paid during 2013 through 2016.  We reviewed a random sample of 100 claims for monthly PACT services to determine whether they complied with Federal and State requirements., Of New Jersey's 100 sampled claims for Federal Medicaid reimbursement of payments for PACT services, 50 complied with Federal and State requirements, but 50 did not.  Of the 100 claims, 21 contained more than 1 deficiency.  We found PACT program services provided were not adequately supported or documented (36 claims), plan of care requirements were not met (17 claims), PACT teams did not include staff from required clinical disciplines (8 claims), and providers did not obtain prior authorization for beneficiaries (5 claims), among other findings.  We also identified potential quality-of-care issues related to PACT services.  Specifically, PACT team psychiatrists associated with 33 of our sample claims did not provide the minimum amount of face-to-face psychiatric time required for their caseload.  Also, despite defining the PACT program as rehabilitative, New Jersey did not require periodic reauthorizations or reevaluations of beneficiaries' program eligibility., The deficiencies occurred because New Jersey did not inform PACT providers of all Federal and State requirements for providing PACT services and did not adequately monitor or have procedures in place to ensure that providers claimed PACT services in accordance with these requirements. , On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New Jersey improperly claimed at least $14.9 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement., We recommend that New Jersey (1) refund $14.9 million to the Federal Government, (2) reinforce program guidance to PACT providers, (3) improve its monitoring of the PACT program, and (4) consider developing regulations for periodic reassessments to determine whether beneficiaries continue to require PACT services., New Jersey generally disagreed with our findings and assessment of the causes of the deficiencies.  Specifically, New Jersey disagreed with our first and final recommendations, agreed with our second recommendation, partially agreed with our third recommendation, and described steps it had taken or will take to implement our second and third recommendations.

                However, Virginia overstated its current enrollments in its bonus requests to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) for fiscal years (FYs) 2011 through 2013 because it improperly inflated its current enrollment by a fixed
                percentage estimate, to account for potential retroactive enrollment, instead of using actual enrollment and the adjustment process to account for actual retroactive enrollment. CMS guidance instructed Virginia to calculate current enrollment

Under CHIPRA, Congress appropriated $3.225 billion for qualifying States to receive performance bonus payments (bonus payments) for Federal fiscal years (FYs) 2009 through 2013 to offset the costs of increased enrollment of children in Medicaid., In audits of CHIPRA bonus payments to individual States, we identified millions in unallowable bonus payments. Therefore, we determined that the CHIPRA bonus payments were a high-risk program area and that the combined findings of our audits should be considered by Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) officials when implementing any similar programs in the future., Our objectives were to summarize the results of our previous audits of CMS's CHIPRA bonus payments to States and to identify any weaknesses that could affect similar programs in the future. , We reviewed the CHIPRA bonus payments, totaling more than $645 million, that CMS paid to 12 States. This report combines the results of those 12 previously issued audits and provides additional feedback to CMS., This report summarizes results from prior audits. Our previous audits of CHIPRA bonus payments identified over $277 million in unallowable payments from $645 million that CMS paid to 12 States. These unallowable payments represented approximately 43 percent of all bonus payments made to these States. CMS has taken significant action to recover these overpayments. Three States voluntarily returned overpayments totaling approximately $37 million to CMS, and CMS withheld almost $51 million from States with unspent bonus payment funds. Additionally, CMS issued letters to States initiating recovery of the remaining $189 million in unallowable payments our audits identified. , These unallowable payments occurred because the 12 States made errors when calculating their enrollment, which resulted in CMS calculating and paying excessive CHIPRA bonus payments. Additionally, CMS did not have access to accurate State data in time to make correct bonus payments and did not use these data once they became available to verify the accuracy of the current enrollment that the States reported for their bonus payments. , We recommend that CMS continue to work with States to collect the remaining $189 million in unallowable payments from the over $277 million that we identified in 12 previously issued reports and consider the results of these reviews when designing internal controls for similar programs to ensure that timely and accurate data are available for adequate oversight, followup, and verification., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions it has taken or plans to take to address them., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
354,A-05-17-00035,The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services Could Use Comprehensive Error Rate Testing Data To Identify High-Risk Home Health Agencies Audit (A-05-17-00035) 09-05-2019,"CMS could use Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) data to identify high-risk home health agencies (HHAs) as a part of a multifaceted approach that includes targeted probe-and-educate reviews as well as aspects of its Fraud Prevention System to further reduce improper payments and the error rate for claims paid to HHAs.  Using nationally reported CERT program data for fiscal years (FYs) 2014 through 2017, we identified 87 high-risk HHAs, which in the CERT sample had an improper payment rate of about 78 percent and approximately $1 million in actual improper payments.  Using Medicare program data during this same period, we determined that Medicare paid these 87 HHAs more than $4 billion for services. , Given the amount of Medicare dollars paid to these providers and the high error rate observed in the CERT sample, focusing oversight on high-risk HHAs and the prevalent types of errors could significantly improve the effectiveness of CMS's efforts to reduce both HHA improper payments and the CERT error rate.  In addition to this data brief focused on HHAs, our office will issue a report related to CMS's overall efforts to use CERT data to identify high-risk providers of all types in the Medicare program.  That report will contain appropriate recommendations for action to further reduce overall CERT improper payments and CERT error rates., In written comments on our data brief, CMS recognized that HHA claims are a major source of improper payments and described past and future corrective actions that address this issue.  These corrective actions include identifying high-risk HHAs by using CMS's Fraud Prevention System, probe-and-educate reviews and targeted probe-and-educate reviews, and a new Home Health Review Choice Demonstration in Illinois.  CMS stated that these sustained efforts have decreased the home health improper payment rate from 59 percent in FY 2015 to 17.6 percent in FY 2018 and are reliable and effective., CMS stated that it does not believe that our methodology for identifying high-risk HHAs is valid, as the CERT data are not designed to be precise at the provider level.  CMS stated that providers with a higher number of claims billed are much more likely to be selected by the CERT review.  Additionally, CMS stated that in the past it has attempted to use CERT data to identify high-risk providers but found these data to be misleading and ineffective.  Therefore, CMS discontinued the practice of using CERT data to identify high-risk providers.  CMS also stated that its payment contractors have more accurate data at the provider level., We recognize that CMS's efforts over the past several years have contributed to the reduction of improper HHA payments.  However, the HHA improper payment rate remains higher than the national error rate of 8.1 percent in 2018 for all provider types.  Moreover, none of CMS's current work precludes the use of CERT data to improve oversight efforts.  Although we agree there are limitations to the CERT data, we maintain that our analysis for identifying high-risk HHA providers is valid and can be used to identify areas of potential risk, including specific HHAs that are high-risk providers needing CMS's attention from either the enforcement or provider education perspective.  , We disagree with CMS that our method for identifying high-risk HHA providers is misleading and ineffective.  Although we don't dispute that CMS and its payment contractors may have additional information employed in its program integrity efforts, our methodology for identifying high-risk HHA providers is valid.  We used valid CERT-sampled data to identify a valid dataset of HHA providers with high error rates.  We continue to maintain that CMS can use CERT data as an additional tool in its targeted enforcement and education efforts to effectively reduce improper payments and CERT error rates., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Specifically, it (1) underreported $18.7 million (Federal share) for six settlements and one judgment by computing the Federal share only on the net proceeds received after fees and interest were removed and (2) failed to report any of the $9.0 million (Federal share) for two settlements. , Wisconsin did not properly report the settlements and a judgment because it (1) lacked policies that addressed the reporting of recoveries from State actions taken because of harm to its Medicaid program and (2) did not have procedures to help ensure that it reported recoveries on the Form CMS-64., We recommended that Wisconsin (1) refund $27.6 million to the Federal Government; (2) determine whether settlements and judgments received after September 30, 2016, were reported, and refund the Federal share of any recoveries not reported in their entirety; and (3) implement policies to ensure that all settlements and judgments are reported properly.

356,A-03-17-00203,Recommendation Followup: Delaware Is Reporting Medicaid Overpayments In Compliance With Federal Requirements Audit (A-03-17-00203) 06-27-2019,"A previous OIG report found that, in 2009 and 2010, Delaware did not comply with Federal requirements to report all Medicaid overpayment collections.  The report had five recommendations that were still unimplemented as of June 30, 2017., Our objective was to determine whether Delaware implemented recommendations from our previous review and is in compliance with Federal requirements for reporting Medicaid overpayments., Our audit covered the five recommendations from the previous OIG report that were still unimplemented as of June 30, 2017.  To determine whether these recommendations had been implemented, we reviewed correspondence from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and reviewed the State's new Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS).  In reviewing the State's MMIS, we covered all 10,130 open Medicaid account receivables on file with Delaware as of March 8, 2018.  We selected a judgmental sample of 38 claims and traced the overpayment amount through the MMIS to confirm that Delaware was accurately reporting the overpayment and refunding the Federal share to the Federal Government., Delaware implemented all of the recommendations from our previous review and is in compliance with Federal requirements to report all Medicaid overpayments. , Two of the remaining three unimplemented recommendations requested that the State agency apply the correct Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate and develop internal controls to enable Delaware to correctly report and refund the Federal share of Medicaid overpayments.  Our review found that Delaware implemented a new MMIS in 2017; this new MMIS has controls to ensure that it applies the correct FMAP.  Using this new MMIS, Delaware is correctly reporting and refunding the Federal share of Medicaid overpayments., The fifth recommendation requested that Delaware identify and report any unreported Medicaid overpayments collected before 2009 and after 2010.  We were able to confirm that unreported Medicaid overpayments after 2010 were reported, but Delaware does not have detailed records of the open account receivables from before 2009.  Because Delaware reported Medicaid overpayments after 2010, and because the State does not have detailed records for the period before 2009, we consider this recommendation to be implemented., This report contains no recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

For this audit, we focused on Nebraska's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) actions related to Medicaid overpayments from legal judgments and settlements that the State had pursued under relevant Medicaid fraud statutes.  Nebraska is required to report recoveries for these MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and to refund the Federal share to the Federal Government., Our objective was to determine whether Nebraska reported and returned the correct Federal share of MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments identified during the period October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2018., We worked with Nebraska to identify what portion of 66 MFCU cases, which resulted in MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments totaling $5.6 million, it reported to CMS for the period October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2018.  We obtained legal documents related to MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments as well as Nebraska's documentation that supported its reporting of those overpayments to determine whether Nebraska reported the correct Federal share., Nebraska did not report and return the correct Federal share of MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments identified during the period October 1, 2011, through September 30, 2018.  Nebraska reported $943,162 ($498,299 Federal share) for this period.  However, we determined that Nebraska should have reported MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments totaling $5.6 million ($3.1 million Federal share) for the 66 MFCU cases that we reviewed.  Therefore, Nebraska did not report $4.6 million ($2.6 million Federal share) of MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments for this period.  In addition, Nebraska did not report $595,723 ($311,352 Federal share) in a timely manner.  Nebraska did not have adequate policies and procedures to ensure that it always reported MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments in accordance with Federal requirements., We recommend that Nebraska refund $1.8 million (Federal share) of the unreported MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments that related to paid claims and that it report and refund up to $781,732 (Federal share) of the unreported MFCU-determined Medicaid overpayments that related to court-ordered awards if and when collected.  We also recommend that Nebraska determine the value of overpayments identified after our audit period that have been collected but not reported, report them to CMS, and refund the Federal share of the collected overpayments.  We make other recommendations for the improvement of relevant policies and procedures., Nebraska disagreed with the amount ($2.6 million) in our draft report's first recommendation and added that it would work with CMS to determine and report the amount owed.  Nebraska also said that it would work with CMS regarding overpayments identified after our audit period and that it would improve policies and procedures.  Nebraska said that some providers went out of business or were bankrupt and added that it was not reporting or refunding amounts that it had not collected.  We revised our recommendations for this final report by narrowing the focus and revising the amount of questioned costs in our first recommendation; by adding a new second recommendation that Nebraska report and refund overpayments related to court-ordered awards; and by clarifying our recommendation that Nebraska determine and report overpayments that occurred after our audit period., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

359,A-01-17-00508,Medicare Made $11.7 Million in Overpayments for Nonphysician Outpatient Services Provided Shortly Before or During Inpatient Stays A-01-17-00508 05-01-2020,"Prior OIG audits identified significant overpayments to hospital outpatient providers for nonphysician services furnished shortly before or during inpatient stays.  In those audits, we recommended that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) recover overpayments, ensure that edits to prevent such overpayments were in place and working properly, and educate providers on the proper billing of nonphysician outpatient services.  CMS generally concurred with our recommendations and implemented them.  However, our analysis of recent claim data indicated that overpayments for nonphysician outpatient services might still be occurring. We performed this audit as a followup to our previous work., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare payments to hospital outpatient providers were correct for nonphysician outpatient services provided within 3 days before the date of admission, on the date of admission, or during Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) stays (excluding date of discharge) for calendar years (CYs) 2016 and 2017., We identified inpatient claims from hospitals with service dates during the audit period.  We used the beneficiary information and service dates from the inpatient claims to identify outpatient claims that overlapped with the inpatient claims for nonphysician outpatient services provided within 3 days before the date of admission, on the date of admission, or during IPPS stays. , Medicare made incorrect payments to outpatient providers for 40,984 nonphysician outpatient services provided nation-wide within 3 days before the date of admission, on the date of admission, or during IPPS stays (excluding date of discharge) that we reviewed.  These incorrect payments occurred because the Common Working File (CWF) edits were not designed to accurately identify all potentially incorrect claims. , As a result, Medicare made $11.7 million in incorrect payments to hospital outpatient providers during CYs 2016 and 2017.  This includes claims beyond the 4-year reopening period.  In addition, beneficiaries incurred $2.7 million in coinsurance and deductible liabilities related to these incorrect payments., We recommend that CMS ensure that all necessary information is included in the CWF edits to accurately identify and prevent incorrect payments for nonphysician outpatient services provided within 3 days before the date of admission, on the date of admission, or during IPPS stays.  We also recommend that CMS direct the Medicare contractors to (1) recover the portion of $11.7 million in identified overpayments (for claims within the 4-year reopening period) resulting from the 40,984 incorrectly billed services; (2) instruct the outpatient providers to refund the portion of the $2,785,607 in deductible and coinsurance amounts (for claims within the 4-year reopening period) that may have been incorrectly collected from beneficiaries or from someone on their behalf; (3) notify the appropriate providers so that the providers can exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule and identify any of those returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendation; and (4) educate outpatient providers on how to correctly bill nonphysician outpatient services provided within 3 days before the date of admission, on the date of admission, or during IPPS stays. , In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with all of our recommendations and described the actions that it had taken or planned to take to address them.  For example, CMS stated that it is currently in the process of updating the automated system edits to accurately identify and prevent incorrect payments for nonphysician outpatient services provided within 3 days before the date of admission, on the date of admission, or during inpatient hospital stays., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
360,A-02-17-01021,New York Claimed Tens of Millions of Dollars for Opioid Treatment Program Services That Did Not Comply With Medicaid Requirements Intended To Ensure the Quality of Care Provided to Beneficiaries A-02-17-01021 02-04-2020,"The United States currently faces a public health emergency due to the over-prescribing of opioid drugs for pain-related conditions.  Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) provide medication-assisted treatment coupled with counseling and behavioral therapies for people diagnosed with an opioid use disorder.  This audit is part of the OIG's oversight of the integrity and proper stewardship of Federal funds used to combat the opioid crisis., Our objective was to determine whether New York claimed Medicaid reimbursement for OTP services provided in the New York City metropolitan area in accordance with Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered more than 10.7 million Medicaid claims for OTP services, totaling over $445 million ($272 million Federal share), provided in the New York City metropolitan area during calendar years 2014 through 2017., 6,700 potentially duplicate claims totaling $267,000 ($160,000 Federal share) from the 10.7 million claims and selected a nonstatistical sample of 598 claims to determine compliance with Federal and State requirements., New York claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for OTP services that did not comply with Federal and State requirements.  Of the 150 claims in our random sample, 115 claims complied with Medicaid requirements, but 35 claims did not.  In addition, of the 598 claims in our nonstatistical sample, 299 claims totaling $8,905 ($5,830 Federal share) were billed in error.  Specifically, 220 claims were duplicate claims, and 79 claims were for services that the providers stated were not provided.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York improperly claimed at least $39.3 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for OTP services during our audit period.  , These improper claims occurred because providers (1) failed to maintain or provide documentation of OTP services, (2) did not ensure that OTP services were provided in accordance with beneficiaries' treatment plans, and (3) did not maintain signatures for OTP services.  Further, although New York inspects providers to verify compliance with Federal and State Medicaid requirements, it did not ensure that its oversight prevented the errors identified by our audit., We recommended that New York (1) refund $39.3 million to the Federal Government, (2) ensure that providers comply with Federal and State requirements for providing and claiming reimbursement for OTP services, and (3) implement procedures to detect and prevent duplicate claims for OTP services., In written comments on our draft report, New York did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations; however, it described actions it planned to take to address them.  Specifically, New York stated that its Office of the Medicaid Inspector General will review the claims identified in our draft report as not having complied with Medicaid requirements and determine an appropriate course of action.  New York also stated it would issue guidance to OTP providers reminding them of their obligations to comply with Federal and State laws for providing and claiming Medicaid reimbursement for OTP services.  Finally, New York stated it would investigate whether edits to its Medicaid claims processing system will be required to detect and prevent duplicate claims for OTP services.

361,A-06-20-08000,Oklahoma's Oversight of Medicaid Outpatient Services for Opioid Use Disorder Was Generally Effective A-06-20-08000 08-12-2021 ,"The United States currently faces a nationwide public health emergency due to the opioid crisis.  The high potential for misuse of opioids has led to alarming trends, including record numbers of people developing opioid use disorders (OUDs).  In 2018, there were 46,802 opioid-related overdose deaths (69.5 percent of all drug overdose deaths) in the United States.  This is one of several nationwide reviews of opioid treatment services in State Medicaid programs.  We chose Oklahoma because it has one of the highest prescribing rates of opioids in the United States.  Other audits looked at Opioid Treatment Program (OTP) services, but Oklahoma OTP providers were not Medicaid-compensable during our audit period because they provided methadone., Our objective was to determine whether Oklahoma's oversight of Medicaid OUD drugs and outpatient OUD services from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019, was effective., We reviewed and tested internal controls at the Medicaid agency and the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (ODMHSAS).  We analyzed OUD drug prescriptions and outpatient counseling services for beneficiaries who received OUD drugs during State fiscal year 2019.  Medicaid paid $5.7 million for 17,127 OUD drug prescriptions and $482,587 for 9,720 outpatient counseling services for beneficiaries who received OUD drugs., Oklahoma's oversight of Medicaid OUD drugs and outpatient services was generally effective.  Specifically, Oklahoma ensured that facilities and staff met the requirements to provide services, recipients were approved to receive services, and payments were accurate.  However, we identified a couple of areas that could be improved.  Specifically, most of the people who received OUD drugs did not also receive outpatient counseling services because Oklahoma does not emphasize counseling in conjunction with OUD drugs.  In addition, Medicaid beneficiaries are not included in behavioral health contract reviews conducted by ODMHSAS because it focuses on services that are paid with non-Medicaid funds., We recommend that Oklahoma consider whether more of an emphasis on counseling could improve OUD outcomes and, if so, take steps to increase the appropriate use of counseling with OUD drugs in outpatient OUD treatment, and develop policies and procedures to ensure that Medicaid behavioral health services are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
In written comments on our draft report, Oklahoma concurred with our recommendations and described actions it is taking or may take to address our findings and recommendations.  Oklahoma also said that it recognizes that individuals who receive medication assisted treatment drugs should receive therapy and other appropriate health services because providing both medication and therapeutic treatment is a best practice. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

The high potential for misuse of opioids has led to alarming trends across the country, including record numbers of people developing opioid use disorders.  In 2019 alone, there were nearly 50,000 opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States.  Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) provide medication coupled with counseling services (OTP services) for people diagnosed with an opioid use disorder.  As part of the Office of Inspector General's oversight of the integrity and proper stewardship of Federal funds used to combat the opioid crisis, we audited OTP services in Colorado., Our objective was to determine whether Colorado's oversight ensured that Medicaid OTP services in Colorado met Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered OTP services provided during the period October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2018, by OTP providers to Medicaid beneficiaries diagnosed with an opioid use disorder.  During this period, 20 OTP providers submitted claims to Medicaid managed care organizations for almost 1.5 million OTP services totaling almost $22.2 million provided to Medicaid beneficiaries.  We selected and reviewed a random sample of 100 OTP services., Colorado's oversight during the audit period did not ensure that OTP services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries met Federal and State requirements.  Of the 100 OTP services we sampled, 21 complied with Federal and State requirements but 79 did not meet applicable Federal and State requirements.  Colorado's oversight of the OTPs consisted primarily of biennial audits conducted by the State Opioid Treatment Authority (SOTA), which were not sufficient in scope and depth of coverage to ensure that OTPs maintained a recordkeeping system that was adequate to document and monitor patient care, or to ensure that OTP services met Federal and State requirements., The biennial audits of each OTP were performed by a single person, covered approximately 10 percent of patient charts, and took between 1 and 2 days to perform.  Given all of the tasks that these audits sought to conduct, we do not believe that reviewing 10 percent of patient charts over the course of 1 to 2 days was adequate for one person to be able to thoroughly review patient charts for deficiencies and to devote sufficient time to other tasks., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that over 1.1 million OTP services, or about 79 percent, did not meet Federal and State requirements during the audit period., We recommend that Colorado strengthen its biennial audits of OTPs to ensure that services provided are in accordance with Federal and State requirements, provide technical assistance to OTPs to ensure that the providers maintain adequate recordkeeping systems, and educate OTPs on the deficiencies we identified to increase their awareness of compliance issues regarding Federal and State requirements., Colorado described corrective actions it had taken or planned to take to address our recommendations.  Colorado said that it had hired a program coordinator to: support the SOTA in conducting the biennial audits; provide technical assistance to OTPs; and manage the Central Registry, a system used to ensure that individuals are not enrolled in more than one OTP.  In addition, Colorado said that it was developing a new automated Central Registry system, and described several planned activities to educate OTPs and review the deficiencies we had identified., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Of the 150 randomly sampled TCM claims we reviewed, 49 claims were unallowable because they had at least 1 of the following errors (some claims had more than 1 error): (1) the TCM providers could not provide documentation supporting that the case managers had the qualifications-that is, the education or experience-required by the Colorado TCM State plan amendment (43 claims); (2) the TCM providers could not provide documentation to support that they had actually provided 1 or more TCM services to the Medicaid recipients (10 claims); (3) the TCM providers' case notes lacked sufficient detail to support that claimed services were allowable (5 claims); and (4) the TCM providers were unable to provide complete documentation of recipients' eligibility for TCM services (3 claims)., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that the State agency improperly claimed almost $2.2 million (Federal share) in unallowable Medicaid reimbursement for TCM services during FYs 2014 and 2015.  , The State agency incorrectly paid TCM providers and claimed unallowable Federal Medicaid reimbursement because its policies and procedures did not ensure that those providers complied with Federal and State requirements for documenting case managers' qualifications, for documenting and claiming TCM services, and for maintaining documentation related to recipient eligibility determinations., We recommended that the State agency refund approximately $2.2 million to the Federal Government for unallowable TCM claims.  We also recommended that the State agency strengthen its policies and procedures to ensure that (1) TCM providers maintain documentation to document that case managers are qualified to perform TCM services, (2) TCM providers maintain documentation to support the TCM services provided, (3) it does not pay TCM providers or claim Federal reimbursement for services that are not TCM services, and (4) TCM providers maintain documentation for eligibility determinations for recipients of TCM services., The State agency agreed that the TCM providers did not keep appropriate documentation.

Medicare telehealth payments include a professional fee, paid to the practitioner performing the service at a distant site, and an originating-site fee, paid to the facility where the beneficiary receives the service.  A Medicare Payment Advisory Commission study of 2009 claims found that Medicare professional fee claims without associated claims for originating-site facility fees were more likely to be associated with unallowable telehealth payments.  We analyzed 2014 and 2015 (our audit period) telehealth claims and found that more than half of the professional telehealth claims paid by Medicare did not have matching originating-site facility fee claims.  Therefore, we focused our review on telehealth claims billed through a distant site that did not have a corresponding originating-site fee.  , Our objective was to determine whether the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) paid practitioners for telehealth services that met Medicare requirements., We reviewed 191,118 Medicare paid distant-site telehealth claims, totaling $13.8 million, that did not have corresponding originating-site claims.  We reviewed provider supporting documentation for a stratified random sample of 100 claims to determine whether services were allowable in accordance with Medicare requirements. , CMS paid practitioners for some telehealth claims associated with services that did not meet Medicare requirements.  For 69 of the 100 claims in our sample, telehealth services met requirements.  However, for the remaining 31 claims, services did not meet requirements.

However, that audit did not cover payments for DMEPOS items that suppliers provided to hospice beneficiaries. , Our objective was to determine whether Medicare properly paid suppliers for DMEPOS items they provided to hospice beneficiaries., Our audit covered $185.7 million in Medicare Part B payments to suppliers for 1.6 million DMEPOS items provided to hospice beneficiaries from January 2015 through April 2019 (audit period).  We identified hospice claims with service dates during our audit period and used these claims' beneficiary information and service dates to identify DMEPOS items that had service dates within the hospice service dates.  We selected 2 stratified samples, with 200 items billed by suppliers.  One sample was for 115 items billed without the GW modifier.  (This modifier indicates that an item is not related to the beneficiary's terminal illness and related conditions.)  Another sample was for 85 items billed with the GW modifier.  For each sample, we contacted the hospices that provided care to the beneficiaries to have them assess whether the items palliated or managed the beneficiaries' terminal illnesses and related conditions., For 121 of 200 sampled DMEPOS items, Medicare improperly paid suppliers for DMEPOS items they provided to hospice beneficiaries.  Specifically, for 58 percent of the sampled DMEPOS items billed without the GW modifier (67 of 115 items) and 63 percent of the sampled DMEPOS items billed by suppliers with the GW modifier (54 of 85 items), the items were provided to palliate or manage the beneficiaries' terminal illnesses and related conditions.  Medicare pays the hospices for the DMEPOS items provided to the beneficiaries as part of the hospices' per diem payments.  These items should have been provided directly by the hospices or under arrangements between the hospices and the suppliers.  , The improper payments occurred because: (1) the majority of the suppliers were unaware that they had provided DMEPOS items to hospice beneficiaries, (2) the system edit processes that should have prevented the improper payments were not effective or did not exist, and (3) the suppliers inappropriately used the GW modifier.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Medicare could have saved $116.9 million in payments during our audit period, and beneficiaries could have saved $29.8 million in deductibles and coinsurance that may have been incorrectly collected from them or from someone on their behalf.  , We recommend that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS): (1) improve the prepayment edit process by instructing the durable medical equipment (DME) Medicare contractors to deny DMEPOS claims submitted by suppliers without the GW modifier for DMEPOS items provided to hospice beneficiaries; (2) implement a postpayment edit process; (3) direct the DME and hospice Medicare contractors, or other contractors as appropriate, to conduct prepayment or postpayment reviews of supplier claims billed with the GW modifier; and (4) study the feasibility of including palliative items and services not related to a beneficiary's terminal illness and related conditions within the hospice per diem.  , CMS concurred with our first and third recommendations but did not concur with our second and fourth recommendations.  We maintain that our second recommendation is valid, but we revised our fourth recommendation., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
369,A-09-20-03015,Medicare Payments of $6.6 Billion to Nonhospice Providers Over 10 Years for Items and Services Provided to Hospice Beneficiaries Suggest the Need for Increased Oversight A-09-20-03015 02-14-2022,"Our analysis of trends and patterns in payments for items and services provided to Medicare beneficiaries outside the Medicare hospice benefit during a hospice period of care (which we refer to as ""nonhospice payments"") demonstrate an increase in Medicare nonhospice payments for beneficiaries.  Nonhospice payments for Medicare Part A services and Part B items and services totaled $6.6 billion from 2010 through 2019.  If providers bill Medicare for nonhospice items and services that potentially should be covered by hospices, Medicare could pay for the same items or services twice.  , Our prior work on Medicare Part D drugs and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies provided to hospice beneficiaries demonstrated that these duplicate payments are, in fact, occurring.  In three prior reports, we made several recommendations to CMS to establish oversight and scrutiny of Medicare nonhospice payments.  Implementing the recommendations from those reports and considering the information in this data brief may help the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) further evaluate the need to potentially restructure the hospice payment system to reduce duplicate payments for items and services that should be included in the hospice per diem payment.  The information in this data brief may also help CMS determine whether the hospice benefit is operating consistent with its longstanding position that services unrelated to a hospice beneficiary's terminal illness and related conditions should be exceptional, unusual, and rare given the comprehensive nature of the services covered under the Medicare hospice benefit., Because this report contains no recommendations, CMS did not provide written comments on our draft report but did provide technical comments, which we addressed as appropriate., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
370,A-06-17-08004,Medicare Part D Is Still Paying Millions for Drugs Already Paid for Under the Part A Hospice Benefit Audit (A-06-17-08004) 08-22-2019,"In 2012, we issued a report to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) indicating that during 2009, Medicare Part D paid for prescription drugs that likely should have been paid for by hospice organizations under the Medicare Part A hospice benefit.  We matched Part A and Part D data to identify occurrences when Part D paid for drugs for beneficiaries who were receiving hospice care at the same time.  We conducted this audit to follow up and expand on the previous audit., Our objective was to determine whether the Medicare Part D program paid for drugs during 2016 that should have been paid for by hospice organizations under the Medicare Part A hospice benefit. , Our audit covered $422.7 million in Part D total costs for prescriptions filled while beneficiaries were receiving hospice care. , We selected a stratified random sample of 200 Part D records and contacted hospice organizations to find out if they should have paid for the drugs. , Medicare Part D paid for drugs during 2016 that hospices should have paid for under the Medicare Part A hospice benefit.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that the Part D total cost was $160.8 million for drugs that hospice organizations should have paid for.  Additionally, although hospices told us they should not have paid for the drugs associated with the remaining $261.9 million of the $422.7 million total cost, a review of CMS communications with hospices and sponsors between 2012 and 2016 indicates otherwise-hospice organizations or hospice beneficiaries likely should have paid for many of these drugs, not Part D. , CMS must do more to avoid paying twice for the same drugs.  As we have previously recommended, CMS should work directly with hospices to ensure that they are providing drugs covered under the hospice benefit.  In addition, we recommend that CMS should develop and execute a strategy to ensure that Part D does not pay for drugs that should be covered by the Part A hospice benefit, which would save at least an estimated $160.8 million a year in Part D total cost, with potentially much higher annual savings associated with the drugs that hospices said they were not responsible for providing.  This should include working with Part D sponsors and seeking whatever authorities are necessary to develop proper controls.  , In written comments on our draft report, CMS stated that its current efforts will address the issue and help ensure there is no disruption in beneficiary access, indicating that it will continue to engage in meaningful activities to reduce duplicate payment in this area, such as ensuring hospice providers are proactively educating beneficiaries on covered services and items (including drugs) and Part D drug plan sponsors are appropriately applying prior authorization criteria and coordinating with hospice providers on drug coverage issues.  We disagree with CMS's assertion that its current activities will adequately address the issue and we continue to recommend that CMS develop controls to stop the duplicate hospice drug payments. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

373,OEI-02-17-00490,Provider Shortages and Limited Availability of Behavioral Health Services in New Mexico's Medicaid Managed Care Report  (OEI-02-17-00490) 9-12-2019,"Medicaid plays a critical role in providing behavioral healthcare.  Nationally, Medicaid is the single largest payor for behavioral healthcare.  In addition, Medicaid enrollees experience a higher rate of behavioral health disorders-which includes both mental health disorders and substance use disorders-than the general population.  In spite of the importance of treating such disorders, many Medicaid enrollees encounter significant barriers when accessing behavioral health treatment.  The need for behavioral health services is particularly pronounced in New Mexico-a State that has among the highest rates for suicide and deaths from overdose in the Nation.  The Office of Inspector General received a congressional request to look into concerns about behavioral health provider shortages and the availability of care for Medicaid managed care enrollees; these enrollees account for most of New Mexico's Medicaid population. , We first analyzed State Medicaid managed care data to determine the number of behavioral health providers serving New Mexico's managed care enrollees by county.  Next, we conducted a survey of 53 selected behavioral health organizations (BHOs) to determine the extent to which these organizations are able to meet the needs of the State's Medicaid managed care enrollees.  In addition, we interviewed selected behavioral health providers, State Medicaid agency officials, and key stakeholders.  We analyzed these data to identify challenges and promising initiatives for improving the availability of behavioral health services for Medicaid managed care enrollees., Many counties in New Mexico have few licensed behavioral health providers serving Medicaid managed care enrollees.  These behavioral health providers are unevenly distributed across the State, with rural and frontier counties having fewer providers and prescribers per 1,000 Medicaid managed care enrollees.  Further, a significant number of New Mexico's licensed behavioral health providers do not provide services to Medicaid managed care enrollees., In addition, most of the State's licensed behavioral health providers serving Medicaid managed care enrollees work in BHOs-which include federally qualified health centers and community mental health centers; however, these organizations report challenges with finding and retaining staff, as well as ensuring transportation for enrollees.  As a result, these organizations cannot always ensure timely access for enrollees seeking behavioral health services.  These organizations also report difficulty arranging or making referrals for services that they do not provide largely because of the lack of providers.  In addition, they report challenges with continuity of care for enrollees, citing limited care coordination and a lack of integration of primary and behavioral healthcare, provider shortages, and barriers to sharing health information, such as a lack of access to broadband service.  Nonetheless, BHOs highlight promising initiatives to increase the availability of behavioral health services, including open-access scheduling, treatment first, care integration, and telehealth., Although this report focuses on New Mexico, it provides insights into challenges that are likely shared by other States providing behavioral health services to Medicaid enrollees.  Therefore, we recommend that CMS identify States that have limited availability of behavioral health services and develop strategies and share information with them to ensure that Medicaid managed care enrollees have timely access to these services.  We also recommend that the New Mexico Human Services Department expand New Mexico's behavioral health workforce that serves Medicaid managed care enrollees.  It should also improve access to services by reviewing its standards governing access to care and determine whether additional behavioral health standards are needed, as well as increasing access to transportation, access to broadband, and the use of telehealth.  Lastly, it should improve the effectiveness of services by increasing adoption of electronic health records, identifying and sharing information about strategies to improve care coordination, expanding initiatives to integrate behavioral and primary healthcare, and sharing information about open-access scheduling and the Treat First Clinical Model.  Both CMS and the New Mexico Human Services Department concurred with our recommendations. "

New York's program accounted for 
62 percent of the Federal share., Our objective was to determine whether New York's claims for Federal Medicaid reimbursement for certain payments made to health home providers complied with Federal and State requirements., Our review covered 4.9 million payments made to health home providers for services provided during calendar years 2012 through 2016, totaling approximately $850 million ($523 million Federal share).  We selected and reviewed a statistical sample of 100 payments.  For each sampled payment, we reviewed the health home providers' service documentation and beneficiaries' health records., For 22 of 100 sampled payments, New York improperly claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for payments made to health home providers that did not comply with Federal and State requirements.  Specifically, New York's health home providers did not provide services according to a comprehensive individualized patient-centered care plan, ensure that beneficiaries participated in the development and execution of their care plan, maintain documentation to support services billed, bill correctly for services, and bill only for services actually provided.  New York also claimed reimbursement for services that duplicated similar ones provided under a different Medicaid-funded program., The deficiencies occurred because New York did not adequately monitor health home providers for compliance with certain Federal and State requirements for providing, documenting, and billing services.
Based on our sample results, we estimated that New York improperly claimed at least $65.5 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for payments made to health home providers., We recommend that New York refund $65.5 million to the Federal Government.

The Medicaid ""health home"" option allows States to create programs that provide care coordination and care management for beneficiaries with chronic health conditions.  Health homes are not physical spaces.  Rather, they are a health care model based on the idea that several providers can work together to coordinate and manage beneficiaries' care at a reasonable cost. , A recent OIG audit found that New York claimed more than $65 million in unallowable Federal Medicaid reimbursement for health home services provided to beneficiaries diagnosed with certain chronic health conditions, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity., Our objective for this audit was to determine whether New York's claims for Federal Medicaid reimbursement for payments made to health home providers on behalf of beneficiaries diagnosed with serious mental illness and/or substance use disorder complied with Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered 1 million payments made to health home providers for services provided during calendar years 2016 through 2018, totaling approximately $186 million (Federal share). We selected and reviewed a statistical sample of 150 payments.  For each payment, we reviewed the health home providers' service documentation and beneficiaries' health records. , Of the 150 payments in our random sample, New York properly claimed reimbursement for 141 payments but improperly claimed reimbursement for the remaining 9 payments.  Specifically, New York's health home providers did not provide a comprehensive patient-centered care plan covering the sampled date of service for enrolled beneficiaries (five payments) and did not document health home services (four payments).  The improper payments occurred because New York did not adequately monitor health home providers for compliance with certain Federal and State requirements for providing, documenting, and billing services. , Health home providers' failure to develop comprehensive patient-centered care plans and provide health home services could have resulted in beneficiaries not getting the services that they needed and may have put their health and safety at risk.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York improperly claimed at least $6 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for payments made to health home providers for services provided to beneficiaries diagnosed with serious mental illness or substance use disorder., We recommend that New York refund $6 million to the Federal Government.  New York should also strengthen its monitoring of the health home program to ensure that health home providers comply with Federal and State requirements for (1) providing services according to a comprehensive patient-centered care plan and (2) maintaining documentation to support services billed., In written comments on our draft report, the State agency did not indicate concurrence or non-concurrence with our recommendations; however, it described actions that it has taken to address them.  After reviewing the State agency's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.

We reviewed a stratified random sample of 150 payments.  For each sampled payment, we reviewed the health home providers' documentation and beneficiaries' medical records or other documentation., Missouri claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for some payments made to health home providers that did not comply with Federal and State requirements.  Missouri improperly claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for 14 of 150 payments.  These 14 improper payments primarily involved deficiencies in documentation.  Specifically, Missouri's health home providers did not always document core services, but all other requirements were met. , The improper payments occurred because Missouri did not adequately monitor providers for compliance with Federal and State requirements regarding the maintenance of medical records that documented the health home services that the providers furnished to beneficiaries., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Missouri improperly claimed at least $3.4 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for payments made to health home providers., We recommend that Missouri refund $3.4 million to the Federal Government and improve its monitoring of the health home program to ensure that health home providers comply with Federal and State requirements for maintaining documentation to support the services for which the providers billed and received payments., Missouri addressed our second recommendation by concurring that the health home programs should be monitored.  Missouri also described its monitoring and training activities for health home providers.  Missouri did not agree with our first recommendation and disagreed with our findings.  Missouri said that the rejected sampled payments complied with the State plan and Federal documentation requirements and that these payments did not violate State policy.  Missouri also said that we had not adequately explained our basis for rejecting these payments, and added that extrapolation was inappropriate in this audit.

377,A-02-17-01027,New York Should Improve Its Oversight of Selected Nursing Homes' Compliance With Federal Requirements for Life Safety and Emergency Preparedness Audit (A-02-17-01027) 08-20-2019,"In 2016, the Centers for Medicare 
&amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) updated its life safety and emergency preparedness regulations to improve protections for all Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, including those residing in long-term care facilities (commonly referred to as nursing homes). Updates included requirements that nursing homes have expanded sprinkler systems and smoke detector coverage; an emergency preparedness plan that is reviewed, trained on, tested, and updated at least annually; and provisions for sheltering in place and evacuation. 
Our objective was to determine whether New York State ensured that selected nursing homes in New York that participate in the Medicare or Medicaid programs complied with CMS requirements for life safety and emergency preparedness. , Of the 621 nursing homes in New York that participated in Medicare or Medicaid, we selected a non-statistical sample of 20 nursing homes for our review based on certain risk factors, including multiple high-risk deficiencies reported to CMS by New York. 
We conducted unannounced site visits at the 20 nursing homes from January through April 2018. During the site visits, we checked for life safety violations and reviewed the nursing homes' emergency preparedness plans. , New York did not ensure that selected nursing homes in the State that participated in the Medicare or Medicaid programs complied with CMS requirements for life safety and emergency preparedness. During our onsite inspections, we identified deficiencies in areas related to life safety and emergency preparedness at all 20 nursing homes that we reviewed. Specifically, we found 205 areas of noncompliance with life safety requirements related to building exits and fire barriers, fire detection and suppression systems, carbon monoxide detectors, hazardous storage, smoking policies and fire drills, and elevator and electrical equipment testing and maintenance. We found 219 areas of noncompliance with emergency preparedness requirements related to written emergency plans; emergency supplies and power; plans for evacuation, sheltering in place, and tracking residents and staff; emergency communications; and emergency plan training. As a result, nursing home residents at the 20 nursing homes were at increased risk of injury or death during a fire or other emergency. , The identified areas of noncompliance occurred because of several contributing factors: specifically, inadequate management oversight and staff turnover at the nursing homes. In addition, New York did not have a standard life safety training program for all nursing home staff (not currently required by CMS), generally performed comprehensive life safety surveys no more frequently than once every 9 to 15 months, and did not check to see whether carbon monoxide detectors were installed. , We made a series of recommendations to New York to improve its oversight of the nursing homes' compliance with Federal requirements for life safety and emergency preparedness. , In written comments on our draft report, New York generally agreed with our recommendations and described steps it has taken or plans to take to address them.

The 21st Century Cures Act allowed SAMHSA to award $1 billion in funding, half in Federal fiscal year (FY) 2017 and the other half in FY 2018 based on a formula developed by agencies and offices within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). , Our objective was to determine whether SAMHSA followed HHS grant regulations and program specific requirements when awarding Opioid STR grants authorized under the 21st Century Cures Act., Our audit covered SAMHSA's Opioid STR grant award process for FY 2017 (October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017).  During FY 2017, SAMHSA awarded 57 Opioid STR grants totaling $484.5 million.  We reviewed documentation provided by SAMHSA pertaining to the grant award process.  We also evaluated whether SAMHSA's funding formula was based on the 21st Century Cures Act, reviewed the funding formula elements, and obtained SAMHSA's explanation for why the elements were chosen.  We reviewed the formula calculation methodology that SAMHSA used to determine the funding amounts for each of the 57 grants., We found that SAMHSA followed HHS grant regulations and program-specific requirements when awarding Opioid STR grants authorized under the 21st Century Cures Act.  Specifically, SAMHSA performed an adequate review of all 57 grant applications and adequately followed up with applicants to address their concerns.  As part of the pre-award process, SAMHSA created teams of expert staff members to review the applications and evaluate the information.  , We also determined that SAMHSA's funding formula elements (unmet need for opioid use disorder and drug poisoning deaths) were based on the 21st Century Cures Act.  According to SAMHSA, these funding elements provided the most comparable and uniform data on a national scale to assess the prevalence of the opioid crisis.  Lastly, we found that the 2018 State Opioid Response grant legislation provides an additional 15-percent set-aside for the 10 States with the highest mortality rates related to drug poisoning deaths., This report contains no recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/samhsa.asp"">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>"

Specifically, we determined that New York State may have claimed Federal reimbursement for childcare subsidy payments made to New York City that did not comply with requirements related to (1) the number of allowable program closure days (e.g., holidays and snow days) and (2) applying families' contributions toward childcare., Our objective was to determine whether New York State complied with Federal and State requirements when claiming Federal reimbursement for childcare subsidy program payments made to New York City.  , Our review covered childcare subsidy claims for children who resided in New York City for the period October 2014 through September 2017.  We identified 140,000 beneficiary-years (all claims for a beneficiary for a 1-year period) totaling $977 million that we considered at risk for overpayment.  We selected a stratified random sample of 210 of these beneficiary-years for review., New York State claimed Federal reimbursement for childcare subsidy payments made to New York City that did not comply with Federal and State requirements.  Specifically, for 209 of our 210 sampled beneficiary-years, New York State paid New York City for partially unallowable childcare subsidies related to (1) excessive program closure days or (2) the incorrect application of families' calculated contributions toward childcare.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York State claimed Federal reimbursement of $24.7 million related to these unallowable payments. , During our audit period, New York City did not have controls in place to prevent these unallowable payments.  New York City officials stated that they implemented controls to prevent these errors from occurring after our audit period.  The officials also stated that, for the final year of our 3-year audit period, they manually corrected claims by applying families' calculated contributions toward childcare subsidies.  , New York State, which is responsible for overseeing its CCDF program, did not detect these claiming issues because its childcare subsidy reviews focused on program eligibility, not on New York City's claims for subsidy payments. , We recommended that New York State refund $24.7 million in unallowable childcare subsidies claimed for Federal reimbursement and ensure that New York City's recently implemented CCDF program controls are properly functioning., In written comments on our draft report, New York State concurred with our recommendations and indicated it would ""continue to evolve"" its oversight efforts and that it is building capacity to periodically test and verify the effectiveness of system controls that New York City put in place., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

MedImpact did not have point-of-sale fees on Part D claims in 2016.  Geisinger stated that the point-of-sale fees were not reported because of an unintentional oversight.   , The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 requires that CMS calculate the difference between the prospective payments received by a sponsor and the actual allowable costs incurred.  The allowable costs are generally payments that the sponsor makes for covered drugs less certain subsidy amounts and reported DIR.  Because Geisinger understated its CY 2013, 2014, and 2015 DIR amounts, CMS used allowable costs that were overstated by $469,850 to make its final payment determination for these 3 years., We recommend that Geisinger refile its DIR reports for CYs 2013, 2014, and 2015 to report the unreported point-of-sale fees ($149,199 for CY 2013, $167,798 for CY 2014, and $152,853 for CY 2015) received from pharmacies., Geisinger concurred with our recommendation that it refile its DIR reports for contract years 2013 through 2015.

The results of our prior audits and these additional requirements led us to review the marketplace's eligibility determinations for the 2018 coverage year.  , Our objective was to determine whether the Federal marketplace determined individuals' eligibility for enrollment in QHPs and for insurance affordability programs in accordance with Federal requirements., We reviewed a sample of 110 of 7.5 million individuals whom the Federal marketplace determined eligible for enrollment in QHPs and for insurance affordability programs during the open enrollment period (November 1 through December 15, 2017) for the 2018 coverage year.  We reviewed supporting documentation related to the eligibility determinations., For our sample of 110 individuals, the Federal marketplace properly determined that all 110 individuals were eligible for enrollment in QHPs and that 102 individuals were eligible for insurance affordability programs.  However, for the remaining eight individuals, the marketplace improperly determined that three individuals were eligible for insurance affordability programs and may have improperly determined that five individuals were eligible for those programs., On the basis of our sample results, for the 2018 coverage year, we estimated that the Federal marketplace (1) improperly determined that 191,896 (3 percent) of the 7.5 million individuals were eligible for insurance affordability programs and (2) may have improperly determined that 402,207 individuals (5 percent) of the 7.5 million were eligible for those programs.  These individuals elected to receive an estimated $40.8 million and $180.1 million, respectively, in monthly advance premium tax credit payments when they were determined eligible.  We also identified a weakness in the Federal marketplace's procedures related to determining eligibility for insurance affordability programs.  This audit covering the marketplace's fifth year of operation did not identify any deficiencies similar to those we previously identified during our audits covering its first year of operation, except for a deficiency related to resolving income inconsistencies., We recommend that CMS redetermine, if necessary, the eligibility of the sampled individuals and take steps to ensure that the Federal marketplace (1) revises its written guidance and establishes new guidance and (2) corrects errors and implements a change in its eligibility and enrollment system.  We also made two recommendations related to a weakness in the procedures for determining eligibility for insurance affordability programs.  (The full text of our nine specific recommendations is shown in the report.), CMS concurred with six of our nine recommendations but did not concur with the remaining three recommendations.  After reviewing CMS's comments, we maintain that our recommendations are valid., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
384,A-02-19-02005,CMS Authorized Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Advanced Premium Tax Credits on Behalf of Enrollees Who Did Not Make Their Required Premium Payments A-02-19-02005 03-01-2021,"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established health insurance marketplaces in all 50 States and the District of Columbia.  The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) operates the Federal marketplace and is responsible for generating advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) made to qualified health plans (QHPs).  We previously audited CMS's interim process for approving financial assistance payments on an aggregate basis for the 2014 benefit year.  We determined that CMS did not ensure that payments were made only for confirmed enrollees and in the correct amounts.  This audit reviewed CMS's permanent process for authorizing APTCs to QHP issuers on a policy-level basis for the 2018 calendar year., The objectives of this audit were to determine whether CMS: (1) ensured APTCs were allowable; and (2) reported accurate enrollment data to the Department of the Treasury's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the IRS to use when reconciling APTCs., Our audit covered 5,339,562 policies for individuals enrolled through the Federal marketplace with APTCs totaling $42.5 billion from January 1 through December 31, 2018.  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 155 policies and the associated APTC payments made to QHP issuers on behalf of the associated enrollees., For 13 of the 155 sampled policies, APTCs totaling $43,455 authorized by CMS were unallowable because they were made on behalf of enrollees who did not make their required premium payments.  Specifically, for seven sampled policies enrollees were improperly confirmed (i.e., treated as if they had made their first premium payments) or provided coverage by their QHP issuers when their policies should have been terminated for nonpayment of premiums.  In addition, for nine sampled policies CMS reported inaccurate enrollment data to the IRS, thereby preventing the IRS from recouping APTCs paid on behalf of enrollees who did not make their required premium payments.  Three sampled policies contained both deficiencies., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that $950 million out of $42.5 billion in authorized APTCs during 2018 for 659,143 policies of 5.3 million policies were unallowable because they were made on behalf of enrollees who did not make their required premium payments., We recommend that CMS work with the Department of the Treasury and QHP issuers to recover or take other remedial action for: (1) the $43,455 in improper APTCs identified in our sample; and (2) the remaining improper APTCs, which we estimate to be $950 million, for policies for which the payments were not allowable.  We also made one procedural recommendation., In written comments on our draft report, CMS did not concur with our monetary recommendations but concurred with our procedural recommendation.  CMS noted that many of the findings we identified were related to data submission errors by QHP issuers.  Additionally, CMS disputed the legal basis for recovering unallowable APTCs. , We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  Even if CMS appropriately authorized APTCs based on QHP issuers' data, these APTCs are still unallowable because enrollees did not pay their premiums on time as required.  Since CMS and the IRS jointly administer the operations of the APTC program, CMS will need to work with the IRS and QHP issuers to determine whether the unallowable APTCs identified can be recovered or otherwise remedied., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
385,A-09-20-03007,Hospitals Did Not Always Meet Differing Medicare Contractor Specifications for Bariatric Surgery A-09-20-03007 02-22-2022,"Bariatric surgery helps those with morbid obesity to lose weight by making changes to their digestive system.  A prior OIG audit found that a hospital's claims for bariatric surgeries performed in 2015 and 2016 did not fully meet a Medicare contractor's eligibility specifications.  Because eligibility specifications varied among the Medicare contractors, we conducted this nationwide audit of hospitals' inpatient claims for bariatric surgeries performed from January 2018 through July 2019 (audit period), for which Medicare paid approximately $279 million., Our objective was to determine whether hospitals' inpatient claims for bariatric surgeries met Medicare national requirements and Medicare contractors' eligibility specifications., Our audit covered $275.2 million in Medicare payments for 24,821 inpatient claims for bariatric surgeries performed during our audit period.  We stratified the claims into four strata (which we refer to as ""groups"") based on the Medicare contractor jurisdictions that had similar eligibility specifications for bariatric surgery.  We selected for review a statistical sample of 120 claims to determine whether the claims met Medicare national requirements in the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) national coverage determination (NCD) and eligibility specifications in local coverage determinations (LCDs) or local coverage articles (LCAs)., Not all hospitals' inpatient claims for bariatric surgeries met Medicare national requirements or Medicare contractors' eligibility specifications.  Specifically, of the 120 sampled inpatient claims, 86 met NCD requirements and applicable eligibility specifications for bariatric surgery, and 1 claim was not reviewed but treated as a non-error because it was under review by a CMS contractor.  However, of the remaining 33 claims, 32 claims met the NCD requirements but not the eligibility specifications, and 1 claim did not meet the NCD requirements., Differing eligibility specifications for bariatric surgery contributed to differences in the number of claims that did not meet the specifications among Medicare contractor jurisdiction groups.  Jurisdiction groups with more restrictive specifications had more claims that did not meet the eligibility specifications and more specifications that were not met.  The Medicare contractors may have issued differing eligibility specifications because CMS's NCD requirements were not specific.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Medicare could have saved $47.8 million during our audit period if Medicare contractors had disallowed claims that did not meet Medicare national requirements or Medicare contractor specifications for bariatric surgery., We recommend that CMS: (1) determine whether any eligibility specifications in the Medicare contractors' LCDs and LCAs should be added to the NCD for bariatric surgery and, if so, take the necessary steps to update the NCD; (2) work with the Medicare contractors to review the eligibility specifications in the applicable Medicare contractors' bariatric surgery LCDs and LCAs and determine which, if any, of those additional specifications should be requirements rather than guidance; and (3) educate hospitals on the NCD requirements for bariatric surgeries if the NCD has been updated in response to our first recommendation., CMS did not concur with our recommendations and stated, among other things, that: (1) CMS will continue monitoring scientific evidence related to bariatric surgery procedures and will evaluate whether an update to the NCD is necessary, and (2) the Social Security Act does not mandate that LCDs be uniform across all jurisdictions and there are valid reasons that variation at the local Medicare contractor level is appropriate.  After reviewing CMS's comments, we maintain that our recommendations are valid., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
386,OEI-05-17-00460,Ownership—But Not Physical Movement—of Selected Drugs Can Be Traced Through the Supply Chain OEI-05-17-00460 02-21-2020,"Drug diversion, counterfeiting, and the importation of unapproved drugs may result in potentially dangerous drugs entering the drug supply chain, posing a threat to public health and safety.  To enhance the security of this supply chain, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) requires trading partners in the drug supply chain to create a record of each drug product transaction.  FDA can use these records to investigate and identify potentially harmful drug products, prevent further distribution, and facilitate efficient recalls., This is the third OIG study about the security of the drug supply chain.  The previous two studies found that overall, selected wholesale distributors and dispensers were moving toward full implementation of DSCSA requirements for drug product tracing, although we found that some tracing documents were missing required information., We used drug product tracing information to trace-backwards through the drug supply chain, from the dispenser to the manufacturer-44 high-risk drug products billed to Medicare Part D by high-risk dispensers.  We reviewed trading partners' tracing documents to determine whether information necessary to trace drugs was present and accurate.  We also surveyed wholesale distributors and manufacturers to obtain information about their documents and interviewed FDA to understand how our results impact its investigations and the safety of drugs in the supply chain., We found that the ownership of 37 of 44 selected drug products could be traced through the supply chain using drug product tracing information that the DSCSA requires.  Seven selected drug products could not be completely traced to manufacturers.  Typically, this was because tracing documents exchanged between the wholesale distributor and manufacturer were missing or had mismatched tracing information.  In one instance, a wholesale distributor refused to provide tracing documents.  When tracing information is missing or mismatched, a complete tracing record for a drug product may not always be available to support investigations of suspect or illegitimate drug products in the supply chain, which could delay investigators.  Indeed, staff at FDA reported that accurate tracing information is critical to identifying a drug product quickly in the event of a recall or when removing an illegitimate drug product from the supply chain., Additionally, for 21 of 44 selected drug products, we found that-unlike with their ownership-we could not trace their physical movement through the supply chain using tracing information.  We could not identify the shipping locations of trading partners (e.g., manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers) or of third-party logistics providers that shipped or stored the drugs on behalf of the trading partners.  Although the DSCSA does not require this information, should FDA not have access to this information in case of a drug safety emergency, FDA and other investigators would need to request additional documents, which could delay investigations and hamper FDA's ability to identify sources of potentially harmful drugs in a timely manner., We recommend that FDA follow up with the wholesale distributor that did not provide tracing information.  We also recommend that FDA offer educational outreach to trading partners about required drug product tracing information and data standardization guidelines.  Lastly, we recommend that FDA seek legislative authority to require information about a drug product's complete physical path through the supply chain on tracing information.  FDA concurred with all of our recommendations."
387,OEI-01-17-00510,FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies: Uncertain Effectiveness in Addressing the Opioid Crisis OEI-01-17-00510 09-25-2020,"While the opioid crisis continued with nearly 47,000 deaths in 2018, FDA used Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) as tools to mitigate misuse and abuse of opioids.  (A REMS is a drug safety program that is intended to mitigate a specific serious risk associated with the use of a drug.)  FDA specifies the requirements and approves the REMS.  However, the drug manufacturer is responsible for developing and implementing the program.  REMS have the potential to help address the opioid crisis, but previous OIG work from 2013 raised concerns about FDA's oversight and the overall effectiveness of REMS programs. This review determines the extent to which FDA has held drug manufacturers accountable for mitigating the risk of opioid misuse and abuse through REMS.  It complements OIG's past work tracking opioid use among Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and provides insight into the Federal response to the national opioid crisis., We analyzed documents related to the REMS for transmucosal immediate-release fentanyl (TIRF) drugs and extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids from 2011 through 2017, including all drug manufacturer-submitted assessments, FDA decision memoranda, assessment reviews, inspection reports, and other analyses and correspondence.  We also interviewed FDA staff about REMS oversight., While the severity of the opioid crisis became more apparent over time and the Federal Government and States launched initiatives to combat opioid abuse, FDA struggled to measure the effectiveness of the REMS for TIRF drugs and for ER/LA opioids in mitigating the misuse of opioids. , For the REMS for TIRF drugs, FDA found data in the assessments suggesting that the manufacturers were not meeting all their goals and also found the data for some of the REMS goals to be inadequate.  From 2014 to 2017, FDA consistently responded to its concerns about the data by requesting better data from the TIRF drug manufacturers or conducting its own analysis.  In 2019, FDA announced a proposed modification to the TIRF REMS that places a greater emphasis on ensuring that patients who are prescribed TIRF drugs are opioid-tolerant, including required documentation and a patient registry to capture needed data.  However, the new goals no longer say that TIRF drugs should be prescribed and dispensed ""only to appropriate patients"" (i.e., patients with breakthrough cancer pain), which may signal to prescribers that prescribing TIRF drugs off-label to treat patients with wide-ranging pain symptoms (i.e., low-level chronic pain, post-operative acute pain, etc.) is appropriate., Similarly, in assessments from 2014 through 2017, poor data left FDA unable to determine whether the REMS for ER/LA opioids was meeting its overarching goal of reducing serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse, and abuse of the drugs.  However, FDA did find that manufacturers repeatedly missed the REMS' targets for training prescribers.  As it did with the TIRF REMS, FDA requested that manufacturers of ER/LA opioids submit more and better data from different sources.  However, FDA was often so late in providing its reviews to the manufacturers that manufacturers had no time to respond to FDA's concerns before their next assessments were due.  Finally, in 2018 FDA modified the REMS goals for ER/LA opioids, moving away from an attempt to measure outcomes to measuring voluntary prescriber training meant to educate prescribers about risks. , FDA faced additional challenges to ensuring that these REMS mitigate opioid misuse and abuse.  In addition to limitations in the data from the drug manufacturers, FDA faced measurement challenges, such as a lack of baseline data, limited surveillance data, and the inability to distinguish the effects of the REMS separate from the other initiatives addressing opioid misuse and abuse.  Further, some opioid manufacturers engaged in deceptive marketing practices that undermined the REMS' educational messages regarding risk.  Furthermore, the fact that both REMS are what is known as ""shared system"" REMS-meaning that they aggregate their data across drugs and product categories-can mask problems with individual drugs or product categories.  Finally, FDA has limited authority to enforce manufacturers' compliance with their REMS., On the basis of our review, REMS are not well-suited to quickly address the opioid crisis.  The REMS for TIRF drugs and for ER/LA opioids both rely largely on educating prescribers about the risks of these drugs.  This takes time to have an impact on prescribing habits and can be countered by pharmaceutical marketing campaigns designed to increase prescribing.  In addition, FDA's deliberate approach to decision-making, which relies on scientifically robust data, focused FDA's attention for years on improving the serious data-quality issues. , Our report had four recommendations.  FDA concurred with our recommendations for it to use the new TIRF REMS patient registry to monitor for known areas of risk, such as inappropriate conversions (i.e., switching a patient between different TIRF drugs inappropriately) and off-label prescribing.  FDA also concurred with our recommendation for it to enhance its REMS assessment review process by completing its reviews in a timely fashion and seeking information on inappropriate prescribing trends from FDA's Office of Prescription Drug Promotion.  FDA did not concur with our recommendation to strengthen the REMS for opioid analgesics (the successor to the REMS for ER/LA opioids) by requiring training for prescribers.  Finally, FDA is considering our recommendation to seek additional authority to ensure that manufacturers are held accountable when appropriate."
388,OEI-03-17-00430,States Could Do More to Oversee Spending and Contain Medicaid Costs for Specialty Drugs OEI-03-17-00430 12-22-2020,"Recent trends have shown that a small number of drugs account for a disproportionately large share of Medicaid spending.  This subset of drugs, often referred to as ""specialty drugs,"" is frequently defined as high-cost drugs and/or drugs that may require special handling.  Each State may define and pay for these expensive drugs differently, which potentially leads to some States paying more than others.  States may also categorize drugs as specialty drugs as part of a strategy to mitigate and control the costs associated with these drugs.  , In addition to State fee-for-service (FFS) programs, Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) provide health care services, including prescription drug coverage, to beneficiaries and are responsible for managing utilization and medical costs.  (We refer collectively to State FFS programs and MCOs as ""Medicaid programs."")  Given the high costs of some specialty drugs, as well as the substantial role of Medicaid MCOs, reviewing how programs categorize and reimburse for these drugs is important to ensuring Medicaid's fiscal integrity., We surveyed 51 State Medicaid agencies to determine (1) whether and how States categorized specialty drugs in their Medicaid programs; (2) the extent to which States conducted oversight of how their Medicaid MCOs categorize specialty drug and reimburse for them; and (3) whether States implemented cost-management strategies to control spending for specialty drugs.  In addition, we obtained Medicaid reimbursement data to compare reimbursement for drugs that were categorized as specialty drugs across Medicaid programs., No standard definition of specialty drugs exists in Medicaid.  Overall, State Medicaid programs used over 100 distinct criteria to categorize thousands of drugs as specialty drugs.  While most Medicaid MCOs chose to categorize certain drugs as specialty drugs, most State FFS programs did not.  Additionally, about half of these drugs had no Medicaid reimbursement data reported by States.  This may mean that Medicaid programs that choose to categorize drugs as specialty drugs reported data for drugs that are not available for purchase and are not updating or proactively managing their lists of these drugs., States reported limited oversight of their Medicaid MCOs' management of specialty drug categorization and spending.  Twenty-four States reported that they were not aware of all the cost management strategies their MCOs implemented to contain specialty drug spending.  Because Medicaid MCOs are responsible for the majority of Medicaid prescription drug reimbursement, a lack of cost containment by MCOs can increase long-term Medicaid expenditures, as States base MCO capitated payment rates on costs and utilization from previous years.  States also may be limited in their ability to set accurate reimbursement for specialty drugs.  CMS conducts the national average drug acquisition cost (NADAC) survey to collect what pharmacies actually pay for drugs.  This is a tool States can use to set accurate reimbursement amounts.  However, this survey does not include acquisition cost data from specialty or mail-order pharmacies.  As a result, 60 percent of drugs categorized as specialty drugs with Medicaid reimbursement in 2018 did not have NADAC data available., We recommend that CMS work with States to expand alternative reimbursement models.  However, given the tremendous variation in the definition of specialty drugs in Medicaid and the fact that most State FFS programs do not rely on this categorization, we recommend that CMS work with States to address high-cost drugs, regardless of their categorization.  In addition, we recommend that CMS provide States with acquisition cost data for a wider range of specialty drugs.  We also recommend that CMS collaborate with States to conduct greater oversight of how Medicaid MCOs manage specialty drugs, which could include a review of contract language that allows States to obtain requested information on specialty drug categorizations, specialty drug reimbursement methodologies, and cost management strategies from the MCOs.  CMS concurred with our first and third recommendations.  CMS did not concur with our second recommendation.  "
389,A-05-18-00018,Minnesota Medicaid Managed Care Entities Used a Majority of Medicaid Funds Received for Medical Expenses and Quality Improvement Activities A-05-18-00018 09-20-2021,"The Secretary of Health and Human Services received multiple letters expressing concerns regarding the oversight of the Minnesota Medicaid managed care program.  The concerns included the lack of transparency of the managed care program, the payments made to managed care entities, and the lack of requirements for meeting medical loss ratios (MLRs).  An MLR is the percentage of premium dollars spent to provide medical services and health care quality improvement activities., Our objective was to examine how Minnesota managed care entities use Medicaid funds they receive to provide services to enrollees., We reviewed calendar year (CY) 2017 cost and premium revenue data for eight Minnesota Medicaid managed care entities.  Medicaid managed care entities are required to calculate and report an MLR for contracts starting on or after July 1, 2017.  For each managed care entity's Medicaid contract, we determined the MLR for the same period and the amount the managed care entities would have had to return to Minnesota if the managed care entities' Medicaid programs were required to meet a minimum MLR of 85 percent. , During CY 2017, Minnesota managed care entities used the majority of funds received for medical expenses and quality improvement activities. Specifically, of the eight Medicaid managed care entities that we reviewed, we calculated MLRs for their contracted Medicaid programs and found one entity that had an MLR less than 85 percent during CY 2017 for one of its contracts.  We determined that the Minnesota Medicaid program could have saved $82,427 (approximately $41,213 Federal share) in CY 2017 if Minnesota: (1) required its Medicaid managed care entities to meet the minimum 85-percent MLR standard for each Medicaid managed care contract and (2) required remittances when Medicaid managed care entities did not meet the MLR standard. , 
During CY 2017, Minnesota managed care entities used the majority of funds received for medical expenses and quality improvement activities.  Further, Minnesota has incorporated a remittance requirement for contracts beginning CY 2018 if MCOs do not meet an MLR of at least 85 percent; therefore, we have no recommendations.

Previous OIG reviews have determined that hospitals
                incorrectly billed for Kwashiorkor, a third type of severe malnutrition. Nutritional Marasmus and other/unspecified severe protein-calorie malnutrition are each classified as a type of major complication or comorbidity (MCC). Adding MCCs
                to a Medicare claim can result in a higher Medicare payment., Our objective was to determine whether the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Authority (the Hospital) complied with Medicare billing requirements when billing for Nutritional Marasmus and other/unspecified severe protein-calorie
                malnutrition., Our audit covered $9,569,586 in Medicare payments for the 497 claims submitted by the Hospital from 2014 through 2016 that contained a severe malnutrition diagnosis code for which removing the code changed the diagnosis-related group (DRG).
                We selected for review a random sample of 100 claims totaling $1,796,325. We evaluated compliance with selected billing requirements and subjected the 100 claims to medical and coding review to determine whether the services were medically
                necessary and properly coded and billed., The Hospital complied with Medicare billing requirements for severe malnutrition diagnosis codes for 10 of the 100 claims that we reviewed. However, the Hospital did not comply with Medicare billing requirements for the remaining 90 claims.
                For two of these claims, the medical record documentation supported a secondary diagnosis code other than a severe malnutrition diagnosis code, but the error resulted in no change to the DRG or payment. For the remaining 88 claims, the
                billing errors resulted in net overpayments of $562,361. These errors occurred because the Hospital used severe malnutrition diagnosis codes when it should have used codes for other forms of malnutrition or no malnutrition diagnosis code
                at all. For these claims, the Hospital-provided medical record documentation did not contain evidence that the malnutrition was severe or that it had an effect on the treatment or the length of the hospital stay. On the basis of our sample
                results, we estimated that the Hospital received overpayments of at least $2,412,137 from 2014 through 2016., We recommended that the Hospital (1) refund to the Medicare program $2,412,137 for the incorrectly coded claims; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify and return any additional similar overpayments outside of our audit period, in accordance
                with the 60-day rule, and identify any returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendation; and (3) strengthen controls to ensure full compliance with Medicare billing requirements., In written comments on our draft report, the Hospital partially disagreed with our first recommendation and disagreed with the other two recommendations. The Hospital also provided comments about the guidance and sampling methodology we used
                in the review and about standards for diagnosing severe malnutrition. We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid for all 88 claims. "

Previous OIG audits of severe malnutrition found that hospitals had incorrectly billed Medicare by using severe malnutrition diagnosis codes when they should have used codes for other forms of malnutrition or no malnutrition diagnosis code at all.  Diagnosis codes E41 and E43 (severe malnutrition diagnosis codes) are each classified as a type of major complication or comorbidity (MCC).  Adding MCCs to a Medicare claim can result in a higher Medicare payment., Our objective was to determine whether hospitals complied with Medicare billing requirements when assigning severe malnutrition diagnosis codes to inpatient hospital claims., Our audit covered $3.4 billion in Medicare payments for 224,175 claims with a discharge date in fiscal year (FY) 2016 or 2017 that contained a severe malnutrition diagnosis code and for which removing the diagnosis code changed the diagnosis-related group (DRG).  We selected for review a random sample of 200 claims with payments totaling $2.9 million.  We evaluated compliance with selected billing requirements and submitted the 200 claims to medical and coding review to determine whether the services were medically necessary and properly coded., Hospitals correctly billed Medicare for severe malnutrition diagnosis codes for 27 of the 200 claims that we reviewed.  However, hospitals did not correctly bill Medicare for the remaining 173 claims.  For nine of these claims, the medical record documentation supported a secondary diagnosis code other than a severe malnutrition diagnosis code, but the error did not change the DRG or payment.  For the remaining 164 claims, hospitals used severe malnutrition diagnosis codes when they should have used codes for other forms of malnutrition or no malnutrition diagnosis code at all, resulting in net overpayments of $914,128.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that hospitals received overpayments of $1 billion for FYs 2016 and 2017., To address the 164 incorrectly billed hospital claims in our sample, we recommend that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) collect the portion of the $914,128 for the incorrectly billed hospital claims that are within the reopening period and, based upon the results of this audit, notify appropriate providers so that the providers can exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule.  To attempt recovery of the overpayment, which we estimate to be valued at $1 billion, resulting from incorrectly billed hospital claims paid during our audit period and to ensure claims made after our audit period are correct, we made additional recommendations.  One of the recommendations includes reviewing all claims that were not part of our sample but were within the reopening period.  The detailed recommendations are in the full report., CMS concurred with our recommendations and stated that it will instruct its contractors to recover the overpayments consistent with relevant law and CMS's policies and procedures.  However, CMS noted that the estimated overpayments we identified represent less than .5 percent of the overall payments made for inpatient services during the audit period.  Despite this, CMS stated that it will instruct its contractors to review a sample of claims in the sampling frame to determine whether they were billed correctly.  Of the claims that we reviewed, 82 percent were not correctly billed, which we maintain is significant and needs to be addressed.  We continue to recommend that CMS review all claims in our sampling frame that were not part of our sample but were within the reopening period and work with the hospitals to ensure they correctly bill Medicare when using severe malnutrition diagnosis codes., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
392,A-05-18-00028,Illinois Claimed Unallowable Telemedicine Payments A-05-18-00028 08-25-2020,"Medicaid telemedicine services are health services delivered via telecommunication systems.  A Medicaid patient at an originating site uses audio and video equipment to communicate with a health professional at a distant site.  Before the COVID-19 public health emergency, Medicaid programs were seeing a significant increase in payments for telemedicine services and expect this trend to continue.  This audit, conducted before the COVID-19 public health emergency, is one in a series of audits to determine whether selected States complied with Federal and State requirements when claiming Federal reimbursement for telemedicine services., Our objective was to determine whether Illinois made payments for Medicaid telemedicine services in accordance with Federal and State requirements., We reviewed 28,647 Medicaid fee-for-service telemedicine payments, totaling $722,471 ($455,769 Federal share), that Illinois made from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2017.  In addition, we reviewed a sample of 100 payments and contacted the billing providers for supporting documentation. , Illinois made telemedicine payments that were not in accordance with Federal and State requirements and were therefore unallowable.  Of the 28,647 Medicaid fee-for-service telemedicine payments in our population, 22,387 payments were allowable, but the remaining 6,260 payments were unallowable.  For 6,205 unallowable payments, the same provider was paid for both the originating site and distant site fee.  Fifty-three claims were inaccurately coded as both originating and distant site fees.  The remaining two unallowable payments were payments for the same originating site fee in the same day.  This noncompliance occurred because Illinois did not give providers formal training on telemedicine billing requirements or adequately monitor compliance.  Based on our testing, we determined that Illinois made unallowable payments of $198,124 ($124,812 Federal share) during our audit period.  , We recommend that Illinois refund $124,812 to the Federal Government, give providers formal training on telemedicine billing requirements, and enhance the monitoring of provider compliance by conducting periodic reviews of telemedicine payments for compliance with billing requirements. , In written comments on our draft report, Illinois concurred with our recommendations and described the actions that it has taken or plans to take to address them., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
393,OEI-05-18-00010,Opioids in Ohio Medicaid: Review of Extreme Use and Prescribing Report  (OEI-05-18-00010) 07-09-2018,"The opioid crisis has been declared a public health emergency.  In 2016, more than 42,000 opioid-related overdose deaths occurred in the United States-115 deaths per day.  Medicaid beneficiaries may be especially vulnerable to opioid misuse because they are more likely to have chronic conditions and comorbidities that require pain relief, especially those who qualify because of a disability.  Although opioids can be appropriate under certain circumstances, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and others are concerned about fraud, abuse, and misuse of opioids obtained through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), including drug diversion-the redirection of prescription drugs for an illegal purpose, such as recreational use or resale. , We based this data brief on an analysis of Ohio's Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) prescription drug records of opioids received from June 2016 to May 2017.  We determined beneficiaries' morphine equivalent dose (MED), which is a measure that equates all of the various opioids and strengths into one standard value.  We also identified prescribers whose opioid prescribing stood out compared to others prescribing to high risk beneficiaries., Nearly 5,000 beneficiaries received high amounts of opioids and did not have cancer or hospice care treatment.  Among those receiving high amounts, more than 700 beneficiaries are at serious risk of prescription opioid misuse or overdose; some received extreme amounts of opioids, while others appeared to be doctor shopping.  Nearly 50 prescribers stood out by prescribing opioids to more beneficiaries at serious risk than others who prescribed opioids to such beneficiaries. , Our results underscore the tenacity of the opioid crisis and the importance of Ohio's ongoing commitment to addressing it.  Ohio has taken a number of steps to address the opioid crisis and has reduced opioid use among its residents.  However, despite Ohio's efforts, we found that some Medicaid beneficiaries and prescribers have opioid use or prescribing patterns that may put beneficiaries at risk and warrant further scrutiny.  OIG supports Ohio's continued efforts to explore new strategies to address this challenging problem."

We also reviewed critical incident reports contained in Alaska's reporting system., Alaska did not fully comply with Federal Medicaid waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings.  Specifically, Alaska did not ensure that community-based providers reported all critical incidents to the State.  For the 303 judgmentally selected claims, 68 percent (205 claims) were not reported to Alaska as critical incidents.  Alaska officials provided various reasons why a community-based provider may not properly report a critical incident to the State, including that the provider is unaware of the incident, fears retaliation by the employer, or has a general misunderstanding of the reporting requirements.  , Alaska did not have a process, such as performing analytical procedures on Medicaid claims data, to determine whether there were unreported critical incidents.  Alaska cannot investigate and take appropriate action to protect the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities when community-based providers do not report critical incidents.  As a result of not ensuring that providers reported all critical incidents, Alaska did not ensure proper responses to critical incidents or events as outlined in the safeguard assurances it provided to CMS in the Federal Medicaid waivers., We recommend that Alaska (1) work with community-based providers on processes to identify and report all critical incidents and (2) perform analytical procedures, such as data matches, on Medicaid claims data to identify potential critical incidents that have not been reported and investigate as needed., Although Alaska did not concur or nonconcur with our recommendations, Alaska stated that, based on our finding, it had initiated corrective actions to (1) implement additional training to increase providers' ability to identify and report all incidents that meet reporting requirements and (2) establish data-mining processes with analytical procedures, such as data matches, using Medicaid claims data to identify potential unreported critical incidents for further investigation., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Of the 30 incidents of potential abuse and neglect in our sample, 23 incidents were properly reported and investigated; however, 7 incidents were not.  Specifically, providers did not properly report three incidents and, for all seven incidents, providers did not meet investigation requirements (four incidents were not investigated on time and three were not investigated adequately).  These incidents of potential abuse and neglect were not properly reported because the individuals responsible for reporting them either initially reported them to the wrong authority or erroneously believed that another provider was responsible for reporting them.  Investigations were not adequately conducted because: (1) some incidents were not reported on time, thereby delaying initiation of the investigations; and (2) providers' internal policies and procedures for investigating internal incidents were either inadequate or were nonexistent.

We also analyzed data on critical incidents that occurred during our audit period to determine whether critical incidents were reported and followed up on in a timely manner., Louisiana did not fully comply with Federal Medicaid waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings.  Specifically, Louisiana did not ensure that: (1) all hospital emergency room visits were reported as critical incidents and (2) all critical incidents were reported or followed up on, or both, within required timeframes.  These issues occurred because Louisiana: (1) did not have a process, such as performing analytical procedures on Medicaid claims data, to determine whether there were unreported critical incidents and (2) was unaware of the extent to which community-based providers were late in reporting and following up on critical incidents. , We recommend that Louisiana: (1) work with community-based providers on processes to identify and report all critical incidents, (2) perform timely analytical procedures to identify unreported critical incidents, (3) ensure that beneficiaries and their families are properly educated and understand that all hospital emergency room visits are critical incidents, (4) track direct service providers' and support coordinators' compliance with the reporting timeframes outlined in the waiver, and (5) correctly track whether direct service providers forward hardcopy critical incident reports to the support coordinator within 24 hours of discovery., In written comments on our draft report, Louisiana concurred with our first four recommendations but did not concur with our fifth recommendation.

407,A-09-19-02005,California Did Not Ensure That Nursing Facilities Always Reported Incidents of Potential Abuse or Neglect of Medicaid Beneficiaries and Did Not Always Prioritize Allegations Properly A-09-19-02005 06-09-2021,"This audit report is one in a series of OIG reports addressing the identification, reporting, and investigation of incidents of potential abuse and neglect of our Nation's most vulnerable populations, including Medicaid beneficiaries in nursing facilities.  Nursing facility residents are at an increased risk of abuse or neglect when health care professionals and caregivers fail to report incidents of potential abuse or neglect or when allegations of abuse or neglect are not acted upon in a timely manner.  , 
Our objectives were to determine whether California: (1) ensured that nursing facilities reported incidents of potential abuse or neglect of Medicaid beneficiaries transferred from nursing facilities to hospital emergency departments and (2) complied with Federal requirements for recording, prioritizing, and investigating allegations of abuse or neglect.  , Our audit covered 4,965 claims with selected diagnosis codes for Medicaid beneficiaries who resided in California nursing facilities and were transferred to hospital emergency departments from July through December 2017.  (We refer to these claims as ""incidents."")  We reviewed a statistical sample that consisted of: (1) all 18 incidents with diagnosis codes that indicated a significant risk of abuse or neglect and (2) 100 incidents with diagnosis codes that indicated a risk of abuse or neglect., California did not ensure that nursing facilities always reported incidents of potential abuse or neglect of Medicaid beneficiaries transferred from nursing facilities to hospital emergency departments.  Of the 118 sampled incidents reviewed, 81 were not the result of potential abuse or neglect; therefore, nursing facilities were not required to report the incidents to the State.  However, of the remaining 37 incidents, 8 incidents were the result of potential abuse or neglect and should have been reported to the State: 2 were reported in a timely manner, 4 were not reported in a timely manner, and 2 were not reported to the State by the nursing facilities.  Although the State issued guidance to nursing facilities on the proper reporting of potential abuse or neglect, facilities did not always report incidents or report them in a timely manner.  For the other 29 incidents, nursing facilities provided documentation that did not contain sufficient information to determine whether the incidents were the result of potential abuse or neglect; therefore, the State was unable to determine whether the requirements for reporting potential abuse or neglect were met.  , California complied with Federal requirements for recording allegations of abuse or neglect and generally complied with requirements for investigating allegations; however, California did not always comply with requirements for prioritizing allegations.  Specifically, for the 118 sampled incidents, the State received 16 allegations; 8 were properly prioritized by the State, but 8 were not.  According to State officials, changes in CMS's requirements contributed to inconsistencies in prioritizing complaints., We recommend that California: (1) strengthen guidance to nursing facilities on reporting incidents of potential abuse or neglect of Medicaid beneficiaries and (2) ensure that its staff are regularly trained on updated Federal and State requirements to ensure that appropriate priorities are assigned to allegations of abuse or neglect., California agreed with both of our recommendations and described actions that it planned to take to implement our recommendations, including issuing a notice to remind nursing facilities of their obligation to report incidents of potential abuse or neglect and developing new training material for field staff. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
408,A-09-19-02004,California Did Not Fully Comply With Federal and State Requirements for Reporting and Monitoring Critical Incidents Involving Medicaid Beneficiaries With Developmental Disabilities A-09-19-02004 09-22-2021 ,"We have performed audits in multiple States in response to a congressional request concerning deaths and abuse of residents with developmental disabilities in group homes.  Federal waivers permit States to furnish an array of home and community-based services to Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities so that they may live in community settings and avoid institutionalization.  The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) requires States to implement a critical incident reporting system to protect the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving waiver services., Our objective was to determine whether California complied with Federal Medicaid waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities who resided in Community Care Facilities (CCFs) from July through December 2017., To determine whether there were unreported critical incidents, we judgmentally selected a sample of 100 medical claims for beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in CCFs that included diagnosis codes associated with a high likelihood that a critical incident had occurred.  For these claims, we reviewed supporting medical records and regional center documentation, if applicable.  We also reviewed 105 critical incidents contained in California's reporting system., California did not fully comply with Federal Medicaid waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities who resided in CCFs.  Specifically, California did not ensure that: (1) all critical incidents were reported and (2) all reported critical incidents were reported in a timely manner and followed up on completely to ensure beneficiaries' health and safety.  In addition, California did not ensure that reported critical incidents involving the death of a beneficiary were properly reviewed. , California provided various reasons that providers and regional centers (contracted by the State to provide a wide range of services for individuals with developmental disabilities) did not properly report some critical incidents, as well as reasons that reported critical incidents were not always reported in a timely manner and followed up on completely.  Because California did not fully comply with Federal and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents, it did not ensure compliance with safeguard assurances it provided to CMS in the Federal Medicaid waiver, which could impact the health and safety of Medicaid beneficiaries., We recommend that California: (1) provide additional guidance to providers, such as a standard reporting form that includes the types of incidents that are required to be reported, and provide additional training to providers on critical incident identification and reporting; (2) provide additional guidance and training to regional centers for identifying the types of incidents that are required to be reported; (3) perform additional analytical procedures, such as data matches, to identify potential critical incidents that have not been reported and follow up on them as required; (4) improve oversight to ensure that timeliness and followup requirements related to reported critical incidents are met; and (5) ensure that reported critical incidents involving the death of a beneficiary are reviewed by a mortality review committee as appropriate., California agreed with our first four recommendations, partially agreed with our fifth recommendation (which we revised), and described corrective actions it had taken or planned to take, including providing technical support and training to regional centers and performing additional analysis., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

We also analyzed data on critical incidents that occurred during our audit period to determine whether critical incidents were reported and followed up on in a timely manner., Arkansas did not fully comply with Federal Medicaid waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings.  Specifically, Arkansas did not: (1) ensure that community-based providers properly reported all incidents of suspected adult or child abuse to the appropriate hotline; (2) provide evidence of review and followup action on all incidents of adult or child abuse; and (3) review all deaths of beneficiaries receiving waiver services.  These issues occurred because Arkansas did not have controls in place to ensure that incidents of abuse, neglect, or death were investigated and reported to the appropriate authority.  Additionally, Arkansas did not ensure that all incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries, including incidents of death, were reported because it did not have waiver requirements to report incidents that occurred outside of State custody or State facilities.  Also, Arkansas did not have adequate internal controls in place to detect unreported incidents. , We recommend that Arkansas: (1) ensure that community-based providers report all suspected adult or child abuse and neglect to the appropriate adult or child abuse hotline; (2) follow waiver guidance for incidents that appear to be abuse that require review and followup; (3) follow waiver guidance to conduct reviews of the deaths of beneficiaries receiving waiver services; (4) consider amending critical incident reporting requirements, including those related to incidents of death, to clearly apply to circumstances in which Arkansas employees or contractors are providing waiver services at a non-State facility, such as a private home, and a critical incident occurs; and (5) perform analytical procedures, such as data matches, on Medicaid claims data to identify potential critical incidents that have not been reported and investigate as needed. , In written comments on our draft report, Arkansas concurred with our first three recommendations and outlined the corrective actions that it has taken or plans to take to address them.  Regarding our fourth recommendation, Arkansas stated that all community-based providers are required to report all critical incidents involving waiver beneficiaries.  Regarding our fifth recommendation, Arkansas stated that improvements to its current controls allow it to identify potential critical incidents that have not been reported and need investigation., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Federal waivers permit States to furnish an array of home and community-based services to Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities so that they may live in community settings and avoid institutionalization.  CMS requires States to implement a critical incident reporting system to protect the health and welfare of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving waiver services. , Our objective was to determine whether New York ensured that community-based providers complied with Federal Medicaid waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings., We reviewed the State agency's system for provider reporting and monitoring of critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings for calendar year 2017.  We reviewed a sample of 30 incidents of potentially unreported abuse and neglect, and a judgmental sample of 48 reported incidents related to beneficiaries with developmental disabilities covered by the HCBS Medicaid waiver., New York did not ensure that providers fully complied with Federal waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings.  Of the 30 incidents of potential abuse and neglect in our sample, 23 incidents were properly reported and investigated; however, 7 incidents were not.  Specifically, providers did not properly report three incidents and, for all seven incidents, providers did not meet investigation requirements (four incidents were not investigated on time and three were not investigated adequately).  These incidents of potential abuse and neglect were not properly reported because the individuals responsible for reporting them either initially reported them to the wrong authority or erroneously believed that another provider was responsible for reporting them.  Investigations were not adequately conducted because: (1) some incidents were not reported on time, thereby delaying initiation of the investigations; and (2) providers' internal policies and procedures for investigating internal incidents were either inadequate or were nonexistent.  Because incidents of potential abuse and neglect were not properly reported or investigated, beneficiaries were put at an increased risk of harm. , Of the 48 reported and substantiated incidents of abuse and neglect in our judgmental sample, we found that the associated providers complied with the critical incident reporting and monitoring requirements., We recommend that New York: (1) reinforce guidance to the provider community on various specific requirements related to the reporting and investigating of critical incidents; (2) issue guidance and/or provide training to the provider community on the importance of identifying the root cause of an incident, and identifying trends in incidents; and (3) review the three internal occurrence investigations identified in our report for compliance with investigative requirements, and make any necessary changes to the incident classifications in accordance with Part 624., In written comments on our draft report, New York agreed with our recommendations and described steps it has taken and plans to take to address them., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) requires States to implement an incident reporting system to protect the health and welfare of the Medicaid beneficiaries receiving waiver services. , Our objective was to determine whether Pennsylvania complied with Federal waiver and State requirements related to 24 hour reportable incidents that involve Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings. , Our audit covered 2015 and 2016.  We reviewed medical claims for beneficiaries residing in community-based settings who had acute-care hospital stays and emergency room visits with diagnosis codes that we determined to be indicative of high risk for suspected abuse or neglect.  We also reviewed 24 hour reportable incident reports that were submitted to Pennsylvania's incident reporting system., Pennsylvania did not fully comply with Federal Medicaid waiver and State requirements for reporting and monitoring 24 hour reportable incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities who resided in community-based settings.  Specifically, Pennsylvania did not (1) ensure that community-based providers reported thousands of 24 hour reportable incidents within required timeframes, (2) ensure that community-based providers and county and regional investigators analyzed and investigated all beneficiary deaths, and (3) ensure that community-based providers referred all suspicious deaths to law enforcement. , Pennsylvania did not have adequate controls to detect unreported 24 hour reportable incidents and did not have controls in place to ensure that all beneficiary deaths were investigated and that all suspicious deaths were referred to law enforcement.  Therefore, Pennsylvania did not fulfill participant safeguard assurances it gave to CMS to ensure the health, welfare, and safety of the 18,770 Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities covered by the Medicaid waiver in our audit.  , We recommend that Pennsylvania improve its controls regarding the reporting and monitoring of 24 hour reportable incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries with developmental disabilities residing in community-based settings.  We made specific recommendations for these controls., Pennsylvania concurred with six of our seven recommendations and described corrective actions that it plans to take or has already taken, but it did not concur with our recommendation that it record the 24-hour reportable incidents noted in our report.  Instead, Pennsylvania stated that it plans to focus on recording unreported emergency room visits and hospital stays that contain diagnoses indicative of high risk for suspected abuse or neglect and take remedial action as appropriate.  We agree that Pennsylvania should prioritize recording unreported incidents that contain diagnoses indicative of high risk for suspected abuse or neglect but maintain that all unreported 24-hour reportable incidents must be reported., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
412,OEI-05-18-00070,Problems Remain for Ensuring That All High Risk Medicaid Providers Undergo Criminal Background Checks Report  (OEI-05-18-00070) 07-10-2019,"An effective provider enrollment screening process is an important tool for preventing Medicaid fraud.  It plays a vital role in identifying unscrupulous providers and preventing them from enrolling in Medicaid.  The Federal Government requires States to conduct risk based screening activities as part of their processes for enrolling providers in Medicaid.  OIG's evaluation of the Medicaid provider enrollment screening process in 2016 found that States were struggling to implement the required screening activities.  Many States had yet to implement fingerprint based criminal background checks-a screening activity required for providers that the Federal Government deems to be at high risk for fraud, waste, and abuse.  If not all high-risk providers undergo criminal background checks, the Federal and State Governments are vulnerable to unscrupulous providers intent on defrauding the Medicaid program., We based this study on data from three sources: (1) a survey of 50 States and the District of Columbia (States) requesting information on their implementation of criminal background checks and the challenges they faced; (2) interviews with officials from 14 of the 18 States that had not implemented criminal background checks by CMS's July 2018 deadline for implementing this requirement; and (3) an interview with officials from CMS.  , We found flaws with States' implementation of fingerprint based criminal background checks for high risk Medicaid providers.  Eighteen States missed the deadline for implementation that CMS had set, and 13 of those 18 States had still not implemented these checks as of January 1, 2019.  Unscrupulous providers could exploit two loopholes in the provider enrollment process to enroll in Medicaid without undergoing these checks.  The first loophole involves CMS allowing States to-in certain circumstances-forgo conducting criminal background checks for high risk providers that Medicare has already enrolled, even though Medicare has not conducted checks on some providers.  The second loophole involves States' reliance on high risk providers to accurately report their ownership information., We recommend that CMS (1) ensure that all States fully implement fingerprint based criminal background checks for high risk Medicaid providers, (2) amend its guidance so that States cannot forgo conducting criminal background checks on high risk providers applying for Medicaid that have already enrolled in Medicare unless Medicare has conducted the checks, and (3) compare high risk Medicaid providers' self reported ownership information to Medicare's provider ownership information to help States identify discrepancies.  CMS concurred with the first recommendation.  CMS did not concur with the second and third recommendations. "
413,A-05-18-00007,Ohio Did Not Ensure the Accuracy and Completeness of Psychotropic and Opioid Medication Information Recorded in Its Child Welfare Information System for Children in Foster Care A-05-18-00007 07-14-2020,"To receive Federal funding for child welfare services, States are required to have a plan for overseeing and coordinating health care services for any child in foster care placement, including medications prescribed for the children.  Psychotropic and opioid medications are among those that may be prescribed for children in foster care.  Medications can have serious side effects, and ineffective monitoring may increase the risk for inappropriate dosing, frequent medication changes, or the use of inappropriate medication combinations.  In recent audits, we found that children's case records did not always contain documentation to support that the required health care services were provided., Our objective was to determine whether Ohio complied with State requirements related to the psychotropic and opioid medications prescribed for children in foster care who were eligible for assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act., We selected a sample of 70 children who were prescribed psychotropic medications and 30 children who were prescribed opioid medications during calendar year 2017.  We reviewed the Medicaid claims data, Ohio's Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (Ohio SACWIS), and the case files to identify the psychotropic and opioid medications prescribed for the children in our samples. , Ohio did not always comply with State requirements related to the psychotropic and opioid medications prescribed for children in foster care who were eligible for assistance under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.  We found that for 61 case records, the medications listed in them were not accurately documented in the Ohio SACWIS.  Additionally, we found that psychotropic medications prescribed for children in foster care were not always correctly identified as psychotropic in the Ohio SACWIS because the medication list in the Ohio SACWIS had not been updated, and the county agency workers were authorized to manually enter medication in the Ohio SACWIS. , We recommend that Ohio: (1) improve monitoring to ensure that county agencies maintain the required documentation in the Ohio SACWIS for the medications prescribed for children in its custody; (2) continue its efforts to obtain access to Medicaid claim data for children in its custody to assist with the monitoring of medications prescribed for the children; (3) implement procedures for the monitoring of opioid medications prescribed for children in its custody; (4) review and update the medication list in the Ohio SACWIS on a regular schedule, at least once a year and as medications are approved or discontinued, to improve the reliability and relevancy of the list; and (5) provide training and technical assistance to county agency workers who input medical and medication information into the Ohio SACWIS., In written comments on our draft report, Ohio concurred with or stated that it is in accordance with our recommendations and described the actions that it had taken or plans to take to address them.  The actions that Ohio described include (1) revising State requirements and conducting outreach to county agencies to address the deficiencies, (2) establishing and executing a data sharing agreement to obtain Medicaid claims data, (3) monitoring trends and usage of opioid and psychotropic medications prescribed for the children in foster care, (4) updating the medication list in Ohio SACWIS on a regular schedule, and (5) providing training and assistance to the county agencies to assist users in recording medical information in the Ohio SACWIS.

414,OEI-03-17-00470,Billions in Estimated Medicare Advantage Payments From Chart Reviews Raise Concerns Report  (OEI-03-17-00470) 12-10-2019,"We undertook this study because of concerns that Medicare Advantage organizations (MAOs) may use chart reviews to increase risk adjusted payments inappropriately.  Unsupported risk adjusted payments are a major driver of improper payments in the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which provided coverage to 20 million beneficiaries in 2018 at a cost of $210 billion.  CMS risk-adjusts payments using beneficiaries' diagnoses to pay higher capitated payments to MAOs for sicker beneficiaries?which may create financial incentives for MAOs to make beneficiaries appear as sick as possible.  MAOs report these diagnoses via CMS's MA encounter data system based on services and chart reviews (i.e., MAO's reviews of a beneficiary's medical record to identify diagnoses that a provider did not submit or submitted in error).  For a diagnosis to be eligible for risk adjustment, it must be documented in a medical record as a result of a face to face visit.  Although CMS requires MAOs to identify chart reviews in the encounter data, CMS does not require MAOs to link these chart reviews to a specific service associated with the diagnoses.  This may provide MAOs opportunities to circumvent CMS' face-to-face requirement and inflate risk adjusted payments inappropriately., We analyzed 2016 MA encounter data to determine the 2017 financial impact of diagnoses reported only on chart reviews and not on any service record in the encounter data that year.  We also analyzed CMS's responses to a structured questionnaire to identify action taken by CMS to review the impact of chart reviews on MA payments., Our findings highlight potential issues about the extent to which chart reviews are leveraged by MAOs and overseen by CMS.  Based on our analysis of MA encounter data, we found that MAOs almost always used chart reviews as a tool to add, rather than to delete, diagnoses-over 99 percent of chart reviews in our review added diagnoses.  In addition, diagnoses that MAOs reported only on chart reviews-and not on any service records-resulted in an estimated $6.7 billion in risk-adjusted payments for 2017.  CMS based an estimated $2.7 billion in risk adjusted payments on chart review diagnoses that MAOs did not link to a specific service provided to the beneficiary-much less a face to-face visit.  Although limited to a small number of beneficiaries, almost half of MAOs reviewed had payments from unlinked chart reviews where there was not a single record of a service being provided to the beneficiary in all of 2016.  Our findings raise potential concerns about the completeness of payment data submitted to CMS, the validity of diagnoses on chart reviews, and the quality of care provided to beneficiaries., Despite the potential for MAOs to misuse chart reviews, CMS has not reviewed the financial impact of chart reviews in the encounter data on risk adjusted payments.  CMS also has not yet performed audits that validate diagnoses reported on chart reviews in the encounter data against beneficiaries' medical records.  CMS reported that it plans to begin audits that would include such chart reviews later this year. , We recommend that CMS: (1) provide oversight of MAOs that had payments resulting from unlinked chart reviews for beneficiaries who had no service records in 2016, (2) conduct audits that validate diagnoses reported on chart reviews in the encounter data, and (3) reassess the risks and benefits of allowing unlinked chart reviews to be used as sources of diagnoses for risk adjustment.  CMS concurred with these recommendations."

The first toolkit includes SAS programming code.  The second toolkit includes R and SQL programming code.  Both toolkits are based on the methodology that OIG developed for its extensive work on opioid use in Medicare Part D.  , The toolkits provide highly technical information to assist our public and private sector partners—such as Medicare Part D plan sponsors, private health plans, and State Medicaid Fraud Control Units—with analyzing their own prescription drug claims data to help combat the opioid crisis. , The opioid crisis remains a public health emergency.  As one of the lead Federal agencies fighting health care fraud, OIG is committed to supporting our public and private partners in their efforts to curb the opioid epidemic.  These toolkits and the accompanying code can be used to analyze claims data for prescription drugs and identify patients who may be misusing or abusing prescription opioids and may be in need of additional case management or other followup.  These toolkits and accompanying code can also be used to answer research questions about opioid utilization.  These types of efforts are particularly important given the COVID-19 pandemic.  The National Institutes of Health recently issued a warning that individuals with opioid use disorder could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, as it is a disease that attacks the lungs.  Respiratory disease is known to increase mortality risk among people taking opioids.  , OIG has developed extensive work on opioid use in Medicare Part D.  OIG most recently analyzed opioid levels in Medicare Part D in a data brief entitled <a href=""/oei/reports/oei-02-19-00390.asp"">Opioid Use Decreased in Medicare Part D, While Medication-Assisted Treatment Increased</a> (OEI-02-19-00390).  The data brief identified almost 49,000 Part D beneficiaries who were at serious risk of misuse or overdose.  Some of these beneficiaries received extreme amounts of opioids.  Others appeared to be ""doctor shopping""-i.e., receiving high amounts of opioids from multiple prescribers and multiple pharmacies.  The analysis identified beneficiaries who are at risk by calculating their opioid levels using Part D prescription drug data., These toolkits provide steps to calculate patients' average daily morphine equivalent dose (MED), which converts various prescription opioids and strengths into one standard value.  This measure is also called morphine milligram equivalent (MME).  The toolkits include a detailed description of the analysis and programming code in three different programming languages (SAS, R, and SQL) that can be applied to the user's own data.  The SAS code, R code, and SQL code provide the same data.  These data can be used to identify certain patients who are at risk of opioid misuse or overdose.  Users can also modify the code to meet their needs, such as identifying patients at varying levels of risk., There are two toolkits.  For the SAS code, use this <a href=""/oei/reports/oei-02-17-00560.pdf"">toolkit (released in 2018)</a>.  For the R or SQL code, use this <a href=""/oei/reports/oei-02-17-00561.pdf"">toolkit (released in 2020)</a>.  The toolkits start with the same two chapters: (1) Analysis of Prescription Drug Claims Data; and (2) Explanation of the Programming Code To Conduct the Analysis.  The remaining chapters contain the programming code."
416,A-01-17-00513,CMS Could Use Medicare Data To Identify Instances of Potential Abuse or Neglect Audit (A-01-17-00513) 06-07-2019,"This audit report is one of a series of OIG reports that addresses the identification, reporting, and investigation of incidents of potential abuse and neglect of our Nation's vulnerable populations, including the elderly and individuals with developmental disabilities. OIG is committed to detecting and combating such abuse and neglect.  Accordingly, we prepared this audit report after identifying a significant number of Medicare claims submitted for the treatment of injuries related to potential abuse and neglect., Our objectives were to determine (1) the prevalence of incidents of potential abuse or neglect of  Medicare beneficiaries, (2) who may have perpetrated those incidents and where they occurred, (3) whether the incidents were reported to law enforcement officials, and (4) whether the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) also identified similar incidents of potential abuse or neglect during our audit period and took action to address them., Our review covered 34,664 Medicare inpatient and outpatient claims totaling $99.6 million for services provided from January 2015 through June 2017 to treat beneficiaries with at least 1 of 17 diagnosis codes related to potential physical abuse, sexual abuse or rape, neglect or abandonment, or other maltreatment.  We selected a stratified random sample of 100 Medicare claims and then reviewed the associated medical records to obtain evidence of potential abuse or neglect., We identified 34,664 Medicare claims for our audit period that contained diagnosis codes indicating the treatment of injuries potentially caused by abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries.  We estimated 30,754 of these Medicare claims were supported by medical records that contained evidence of potential abuse or neglect.  We further estimated that, of the claims in our population associated with incidents of potential abuse or neglect, 2,574 were allegedly perpetrated by a healthcare worker, 3,330 were related to incidents that occurred in a medical facility, and 9,294 were related to incidents that were not reported to law enforcement., CMS did not identify similar incidents of potential abuse or neglect during our period of review, but it did take some corrective actions in response to the Early Alert we sent to CMS.  CMS did not identify the Medicare claims that indicate potential abuse or neglect because, according to CMS officials, it did not extract data consisting of Medicare claims containing the 17 diagnosis codes related to abuse or neglect.  The lack of a data extract impeded the ability of CMS or of public and patient safety organizations to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the safety, health, and rights of Medicare beneficiaries., We recommend that CMS (1) compile a complete list of diagnosis codes that indicate potential physical or sexual abuse and neglect; (2) use that complete list to conduct periodic data extracts of all Medicare claims containing at least one of those codes; (3) inform States that the extracted Medicare claims data are available to help States ensure compliance with their mandatory reporting laws; and (4) assess the sufficiency of existing Federal requirements, such as conditions of participation and section 1150B of the Social Security Act, to report suspected abuse and neglect of Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of where services are provided, and strengthen those requirements or seek additional authorities as appropriate., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our fourth recommendation but did not concur with our first three recommendations.  Specifically, CMS stated that claims data may not be timely enough to address acute problems in identifying and addressing potential abuse or neglect of Medicare beneficiaries.  We respectfully disagree with CMS and continue to recommend the use of the Medicare claims data to identify and address potential abuse and neglect of beneficiaries., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

The guide includes a flow chart showing key decision points in the process and the detailed lessons that the OIG has learned using this approach.  We encourage our public and private sector partners to use this guide to develop a process tailored to their specific circumstances and apply it to any vulnerable population they deem appropriate.  The source of the data could include Medicaid Management Information Systems claims data, private payor insurance claims data, or similar data sets.  Analyzing the data to target which medical records should be reviewed can help identify individual incidents of unreported abuse or neglect, patterns and trends of abuse or neglect involving specific providers, beneficiaries, or patients who may require immediate intervention to protect their health, safety and rights.  The guide also provides technical information, such as examples of medical diagnosis codes, to support our public and private sector partners with analyzing their own claims data to help combat abuse and neglect., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

420,OEI-03-18-00120,Medicare Part B Drug Payments: Impact of Price Substitutions Based on 2016 Average Sales Prices Report  (OEI-03-18-00120) 08-06-2018,"When Congress established average sales price (ASP) as the basis for Medicare Part B drug reimbursement, it also provided a mechanism for monitoring market prices and limiting potentially excessive payment amounts.  The Social Security Act mandates that OIG compare ASPs with average manufacturer prices (AMPs).  If OIG finds that the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by a certain percentage (currently 5 percent), the Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to substitute the ASP based payment amount with a lower calculated rate.  Through regulation, CMS outlined that it would only make this substitution only if the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by 5 percent in the 2 previous quarters or 3 of the previous 4 quarters., Over the last decade, OIG has produced annual reports aggregating the results of our mandated quarterly ASP to AMP comparisons.  This annual report quantifies the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries that are a direct result of CMS's price substitution policy based on 2016 average sales prices, and this report also offers recommendations for achieving additional savings., To determine the effects of the price substitution policy, we determined the difference between ASP-based payment and AMP-based payment for each drug with a price substitution.  We then applied this difference to the Medicare utilization for each of these drugs.  To account for a 3 quarter lag between the reporting of pricing data and applying price substitutions, we used drug utilization data for the fourth quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017 to calculate the savings based on 2016 ASP data. , <p align=""center""><img alt=""Please read previous bullet points for a text-based explanation of this graphic"" src=""./price-substitutions_2018.jpg""/>, Because of the potential for savings to Medicare beneficiaries and the program, OIG recommends that CMS expand the price-substitution policy.  CMS did not concur with the recommendation, instead stating that as additional data become available and as it continues to gain experience with the price substitution policy, it will consider further changes as necessary.  OIG recognizes that CMS, in setting policy for payment substitution, needs to balance safeguarding access to drugs and ensuring that Medicare and its beneficiaries do not overpay for drugs.  To provide greater flexibility and achieve this continued balance, any future expansion of the payment-substitution policy could contain a provision that would prevent a price substitution when there are indications that the substitution amount is below provider acquisition costs."
421,A-05-18-00024,Medicare Contractors Were Not Consistent in How They Reviewed Extrapolated Overpayments in the Provider Appeals Process A-05-18-00024 08-25-2020,"When an overpayment is identified in Medicare Part A or Part B, providers have the right to contest the overpayment amount using the Medicare administrative appeals process.  If a statistical estimate of an overpayment (an extrapolated overpayment) is overturned during the administrative appeals process, then the provider is liable for the overpayment identified in the sample but not the extrapolated amount.  Given the large difference between overpayment amounts in the sample and extrapolated amounts, it is critical that the process for reviewing extrapolations during an appeal is fair and reasonably consistent.  In the first and second levels of the appeals process, such extrapolated overpayments are reviewed by Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) and qualified independent contractors (QICs), respectively., Our objective was to determine whether the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) ensured that MACs and QICs reviewed appealed extrapolated overpayments consistently and in a manner that conforms with existing CMS requirements., We surveyed the contractors about their processes for reviewing extrapolated overpayments.  In addition, we interviewed the statistical groups at three contractors about their experiences with the appeals process.  We audited three separate nonstatistical samples of appeals cases. , Although MACs and QICs generally reviewed appealed extrapolated overpayments in a manner that conforms with existing CMS requirements, CMS did not always provide sufficient guidance and oversight to ensure that these reviews were performed in a consistent manner.  The most significant inconsistency we identified involved the use of a type of simulation testing that was performed only by a subset of contractors.  The test was associated with at least $42 million in extrapolated overpayments that were overturned in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.  If CMS did not intend that the contractors use this procedure, these extrapolations should not have been overturned.  Conversely, if CMS intended that contractors use this procedure, it is possible that other extrapolations should have been overturned but were not.  In addition, CMS's ability to provide oversight over the extrapolation review process was limited because of data reliability issues in the Medicare Appeals System (MAS).  Of the 39 appeals cases we reviewed that were listed in the MAS as involving extrapolation, 19 cases did not actually involve statistical sampling.  Improving the accuracy of the information in the MAS would potentially assist CMS with ensuring that extrapolated overpayments are reviewed by the MACs and QICs in a consistent manner., We recommend that CMS: (1) provide additional guidance to contractors to ensure reasonable consistency in procedures used to review extrapolated overpayments during the first two levels of the Medicare Parts A and B appeals process; (2) take steps to identify and resolve discrepancies in the procedures contractors use to review extrapolations during the appeals process; (3) provide guidance regarding the organization of extrapolation-related files that must be submitted in response to a provider appeal; (4) improve system controls to reduce the risk of contractors incorrectly marking the extrapolation flag field in the MAS; and (5) update the information in the MAS to accurately reflect extrapolation amounts challenged as part of an appeal, whether the extrapolation was reviewed by a contractor, and the outcome of any extrapolation review., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendations and described the actions that it has taken or plans to take to address them.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

We performed this audit to determine whether ACL appropriately oversaw the activities of independent living programs. , Our objective was to determine specifically whether ACL conducted required onsite compliance reviews or any other monitoring activities of independent living programs. , We obtained and reviewed documentation from ACL, such as monitoring policies and procedures and lists of grantees, to determine whether ACL conducted required onsite compliance reviews or any other monitoring activities of independent living programs. We limited our review to 284 Centers for Independent Living grantees that received funds under section 722 of the Rehabilitation Act (the Act) and 2 Independent Living Services grantees that received funds under section 723 of the Act.  The Centers for Independent Living grantees received $146.6 million, and the Independent Living Services grantees received $4.8 million during the audit period, October 1, 2015, through September 30, 2017., ACL did not appropriately oversee the activities of the two independent living programs.  Specifically, ACL has not conducted any onsite compliance reviews of either the Centers for Independent Living program or Independent Living Services program since beginning its oversight of the programs in July 2014. , Although ACL conducted some monitoring activities as part of the Compliance and Outcome Monitoring Protocol (COMP) program, ACL's comprehensive and targeted desk reviews did not include any onsite compliance reviews of the programs as of December 31, 2018.  ACL was appropriated $156.6 million for independent living program services during the audit period.  Of this amount, ACL awarded $151.4 million to grantees for independent living program services.  However, ACL did not allocate sufficient funds to support onsite compliance reviews. , ACL officials said that they were unable to conduct onsite compliance reviews because of limited travel funding.  Without the required onsite compliance reviews, there is no assurance that independent living programs are effectively working to maximize the independence, well-being, and health of older adults, people with disabilities, and the families and caregivers of both. , We recommend that ACL determine whether it can allocate its funds differently to enable onsite compliance reviews, seek additional department funding or resources to conduct the onsite compliance reviews, and perform required onsite compliance reviews of independent living programs. , In written comments on our draft report, ACL generally did not state whether it concurred with our recommendations but described actions it has taken, or plans to take, in response to the recommendations.  ACL responded that it is not seeking resources to support a set percentage of onsite compliance reviews but will seek resources to conduct reviews, including onsite reviews, based on the risk, scope, and scale of the issues. , Although ACL's implementation of the COMP could include onsite reviews to address compliance concerns, we continue to recommend that ACL determine whether it can allocate the funds needed to conduct required onsite compliance reviews of independent living programs., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/aoa.asp"">Administration on Aging</a>"
424,A-01-18-02501,Vermont's Office of Child Support Needs Better Oversight Over Its Administrative Costs Claimed Audit (A-01-18-02501) 09-06-2019,"In Vermont, child support services are provided by the State Office of Child Support (State agency) under a cooperative agreement with the Vermont Supreme Court. The State agency claims the costs for the courts that are related to child support services. Based on a prior Office of Child Support Enforcement audit and current issues we found during our preliminary review, we selected court costs specific to the cooperative agreement for review. , Our objective was to determine whether the State agency claimed administrative court costs for the Title IV-D Child Support Enforcement Program (the CSE program) that were allowable and in accordance with Federal and State requirements. , We reviewed direct staff salaries and building-space costs, which represents a high percentage of the total eligible Title IV-D costs included in the establishment of the county rates. We performed analysis on the 2016 through 2017 motions, petitions, and requests (MPRs) invoiced by the court and reimbursed by the State agency during our audit period., The State agency claimed IV-D administrative costs that were not allowable or supported during Federal fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Specifically, we found the State agency claimed (1) $180,288 ($118,990 Federal share) in unallowable costs for 1,000 duplicate MPRs out of 17,919, which had been paid previously; (2) $48,891 ($32,268 Federal share) in unallowable costs due to the incorrect IV-D county rate paid of $186.84 instead of $144.62 to one county for all 1,158 MPRs; and (3) $1.37 million ($907,051 Federal share) in unsupported costs due to the salary allocation of 156 employees included in individual county rates. , The State agency claimed these unallowable and unsupported costs because it did not (1) ensure the court MPR processing system had edits and controls in place to prevent or detect duplicate MPRs from being processed (2) have any policies and procedures in place for the review and approval of invoices and supporting documentation prior to the payment to the court administrator's office, and (3) have any policies and procedures in place for allocating salaries to the individual family courts which could have ensured allocations are supported and accurately reflect the relative benefits received. As a result, the State agency included $229,179 ($151,258 Federal share) in unallowable expenditures and $1.37 million ($907,051 Federal share) in unsupported costs on the OCSE-396 quarterly reports during our audit period. , We recommend that the Vermont Office of Child Support (1) refund $229,179 ($151,258 Federal share) in unallowable expenditures, and (2) work with ACF to determine what portion of the $1.37 million ($907,051 Federal share) for unsupported salaries allocated represents Title IV-D eligible costs or refund the entire amount. We also make procedural recommendations to improve the State agency's CSE program operations. , In written comments on our draft report, the State agency concurred with our recommendations. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

Audits of Head Start and other HHS grantees have found deficiencies in the way grantees claim and account for grant funds., The objective of our audit was to determine whether Opportunities for Williamson and Burnet Counties (Opportunities) claimed and accounted for HHS grant funds in accordance with Federal requirements., From December 2016 through November 2017, Opportunities claimed $7.4 million in Head Start grant costs.  From January through December 2017, Opportunities claimed $653,867 in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) costs and $442,773 in Community Service Block Grant program (CSBG) costs.  We limited our audit to a judgmental sample of 108 Head Start, LIHEAP, and CSBG general ledger transaction line items totaling $359,056., 
Opportunities did not always account for costs in accordance with Federal regulations.  Specifically, Opportunities drew down grant funds without an immediate cash need; did not track expenses in a way that provided for accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal program; did not maintain internal controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance that expenses were approved in accordance with internal policies; used unapproved methods to allocate shared costs; and did not allocate indirect costs to programs relative to the benefits received.  In addition, Opportunities claimed some unallowable costs., We recommend that Opportunities (1) implement procedures designed to ensure that Federal funds are drawn down only in the amounts needed to meet the immediate cash requirements of its CSBG and LIHEAP-related activities; (2) work with Cost Allocation Services to either be released from the existing indirect cost rate or negotiate a current indirect cost rate for claiming future indirect costs; (3) develop and implement a reasonable basis to allocate meal costs, kitchen salaries and central office expenses between the Head Start and Senior Nutrition programs in accordance with the benefits received; and (4) refund $3,207 in unallowable costs., In written comments on our draft report, Opportunities agreed with our recommendations.

We selected Gateway Community Action Partnership (Gateway) for this audit because it received multiple HHS Administration for Children and Families (ACF) grant funds, including Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief Act grants totaling $19.7 million, and grants to operate childcare programs at more than 50 locations. , Our objective was to determine whether Gateway claimed and accounted for HHS grant funds in accordance with Federal requirements., Gateway officials provided accounting records that detailed the expenditures claimed for the ACF grants for our March 2015 through January 2018 audit period.  From these records, we judgmentally selected and reviewed 100 transactions, totaling $5.5 million.  Based on the results of our analysis, we reviewed additional transactions related to indirect costs, certain credits, playground contract procurement, personal use of company vehicles., We also reviewed Gateway's construction of a new Head Start Facility and major renovations to two facilities to determine whether Gateway complied with Federal requirements related to construction and major renovations., Gateway did not account for HHS grant funds in accordance with Federal requirements.  Specifically, Gateway claimed $932,607 of unallowable costs and did not comply with Federal regulations on construction and renovations.  These deficiencies occurred because Gateway did not have all necessary procedures in place and did not adhere to Federal procurement requirements, and ACF's monitoring did not ensure that Gateway complied with Federal requirements related to construction and renovations.  Further, some expenditures were not properly allocated.  Finally, ACF relied on Gateway's documentation and did not thoroughly review it for consistency and accuracy., We recommend that Gateway refund $932,607 and ensure compliance with Federal requirements and the accuracy of information submitted to ACF.  We also recommend that ACF ensure that Gateway complies with Federal requirements and verifies submitted information to support Gateway's grant award applications, including requesting independent analyses of cost comparisons for Head Start facility construction and major renovations., Gateway partially concurred with our first recommendation and agreed to refund $29,523.  Gateway did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our second and third recommendations.  Gateway contended that its updates and follows it procedures to ensure compliance with Federal requirements. , ACF did not concur with our recommendation that it should ensure Gateway complies with Federal regulations and verifies submitted information.  ACF stated that it took steps to ensure Gateway complied with Federal requirements and verified information submitted by Gateway supported its grant applications.  , After reviewing Gateway and ACF's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid because neither Gateway nor ACF provided sufficient evidence of compliance with Federal requirements related to the transactions we audited, including construction and renovations costs. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"
428,A-01-19-02500,Cape Cod Child Development Program Did Not Meet Its Head Start Non-Federal Share Obligations A-01-19-02500 04-16-2020,"The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), within HHS, requested that we audit Cape Cod Child Development Program, Inc. (CCCDP) after ACF found significant governance, financial, and programmatic problems with CCCDP's Head Start program.  , Our audit objective was to determine whether CCCDP met its Head Start non-Federal share obligations in accordance with Federal Head Start requirements and the conditions of its Head Start awards., Our original audit objective was to determine whether CCCDP appropriately allocated and claimed approximately $17.3 million in costs to its HHS direct and State pass-through grants from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2019, in accordance with Federal requirements.  Because CCCDP ceased its childcare operations in August 2019 and filed for bankruptcy in October 2019, we adjusted our audit objective to cover only the $1.53 million in Head Start non-Federal share for which CCCDP provided documentation., CCCDP did not meet its Head Start non-Federal share obligations.  CCCDP received almost $9.7 million in Federal Head Start funds from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2019, and was obligated to contribute $2.4 million.  However, CCCDP provided documentation for only $1.53 million in non-Federal share contributions.  Of that amount, we determined that almost $1.47 million was unallowable. , The remaining $61,857 in supported contributions was allowable.  In addition, we identified $859,527 in State Head Start funding that CCCDP could have included as NSF contributions and which we considered allowable contributions.  Thus, total allowable contributions were $921,384 and CCCDP's non-Federal share contribution shortfall was almost $1.50 million.  CCCDP received and spent almost $1.2 million in Federal Head Start funding related to that shortfall to which it was not entitled. , CCCDP did not meet its Head Start non-Federal share because CCCDP (1) management did not understand the Head Start non-Federal share requirements for determining allowable non-Federal share and valuing donated program space and (2) did not have written policies and procedures for ensuring that it met its Head Start non-Federal share requirements and maintained complete and accurate documentation for non-Federal share contributions, including how non-Federal share contributions were valued and the source of non-Federal funds., We recommend that ACF take steps through the bankruptcy process to recover almost $1.2 million in Federal Head Start funds based on CCCDP's approximately $1.50 million non-Federal share shortfall.  Because CCCDP filed for bankruptcy, we are addressing the recommendations of this audit to ACF. , In written comments to our draft report, ACF concurred with our recommendation and stated that it will take steps through the bankruptcy process to try to recover $1,196,293 in Federal Head Start funds., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

Our prior audit (A-04-14-04026) of Wateree Community Actions, Inc. (Wateree), for fiscal years (FYs) 2012 and 2013, found that Wateree improperly managed some Federal funds related to HHS programs.  As a result, Wateree put at risk both vital Federal funds and its ability to continue as a viable organization assisting low-income households in South Carolina., Our objectives were to (1) determine whether Wateree allocated and claimed costs in accordance with Federal requirements and (2) follow up on the findings identified in our prior OIG audit., We audited HHS grant funding and expenditures during FYs 2016 and 2017 (audit period).  Our audit covered three HHS program grants for which Wateree claimed $27.4 million in costs during the audit period.  We also followed up on findings identified in OIG's prior audit report, as well as in Wateree's 2015 Single Audit, and we audited Wateree's ongoing actions to address these issues after 2017., Wateree continued to experience financial management problems related to its Federal programs because it misallocated funds or claimed duplicate Head Start program costs in violation of Federal requirements, did not meet its non-Federal match requirement for Head Start, and continued to file Federal and non-Federal reports inaccurately or late.  However, Wateree resolved one prior OIG audit finding and improved its financial condition., These deficiencies occurred because Wateree did not have adequate cash management or other controls.  As a result, Wateree mismanaged $354,597 in Federal funds, is subject to a Federal funds disallowance of $252,591, and may incur other administrative actions from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)., Since the end of our audit period, Wateree has taken steps to improve its cash management system.  Specifically, Wateree has instituted a new accounting system, which it believes will provide better accountability.  After the initiation of our audit and our discussion of the $354,597 of unallowable Head Start costs with both ACF and Wateree officials, Wateree repaid the unallowable amount., We recommend that Wateree monitor the non-Federal match it is receiving throughout the budget year and, if needed, either request a waiver from ACF immediately upon determining that it cannot meet its match requirements or adjust its Federal funds grant expenditures accordingly; and ensure adequate controls are in place to prevent invoicing both Head Start and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Child Nutrition programs for the same expenses.  We also made two procedural recommendations., In written comments on our draft report, Wateree described actions taken or processes implemented to address our recommendations.

430,OEI-06-17-00530,Incidence of Adverse Events in Indian Health Service Hospitals OEI-06-17-00530 12-10-2020,"OIG conducted this review to estimate the incidence of adverse events and temporary harm events in IHS hospitals and to assess the extent to which these events were preventable.  Adverse events and temporary harm events, also referred to as patient harm events, indicate that a patients' care resulted in an undesirable clinical outcome not caused by underlying disease.  IHS provides comprehensive Federal health services to approximately 2.6 million American Indians and Alaska Natives—a medically vulnerable population with poorer health outcomes and barriers to accessing health care.  Prior OIG reports have identified longstanding challenges to IHS's ability to deliver safe and high-quality health care to American Indians and Alaska Natives.  Challenges faced by IHS hospitals include staffing shortages and lack of specialty care, with the agency's Great Plains Area being a location of particular concern.  This report is part of an OIG series of reports about adverse events in health care settings and continues OIG's commitment to monitoring the quality of care at IHS facilities., We selected a stratified random sample of 400 patients, from pediatric patients to older adults, who had at least one admission to an IHS hospital during fiscal year (FY) 2017.  Our final sample consisted of 384 patients because of ineligible admissions and missing medical records.  We calculated the incidence rate of patient harm events in IHS hospitals from a review of patients' medical records.  We conducted the review in two stages.  In the first stage, nurses screened the records for possible patient harm events using a ""trigger tool method.""  A ""trigger"" is a clinical clue—for example, documentation of a fall—that may indicate harm.  In the second stage, physician-reviewers conducted a full review of the medical records flagged by nurses as containing possible harm events.  Physician-reviewers identified harm events and assessed the level of harm, whether events were preventable, and factors that contributed to events., An estimated 13 percent of patients in IHS hospitals experienced patient harm events during their stays in FY 2017.  We found a higher rate of harm in smaller IHS hospitals (those with fewer than 1,000 admissions in FY 2017).  Most patient harm events we identified were temporary harm events, and more than half of patient harm events were related to the use of medication.  In our sample, patient harm events were more prevalent among older adults (65 and older) and labor and delivery patients (any age), whereas pediatric patients (up to and including 17 years of age) had very few harm events.  An estimated 7 percent of patients overall—slightly over half of the 13 percent of patients who experienced harm events—experienced events that were preventable, i.e., they could have been prevented if the patients had been given better care.  , In an effort to reduce patient harm, OIG recommends that IHS's Office of Quality establish patient harm monitoring and reduction as a key priority.  IHS should also use an improved and fully implemented incident reporting system to effectively track and monitor patient harm events.  We further recommend that IHS implement quality improvement plans to improve patient safety across IHS, including plans that specifically focus on smaller hospitals and patient groups at higher risk of harm.  IHS concurred with our recommendations and affirmed that patient safety is a high priority for the agency.  Actions reported by IHS included enhanced partnerships, such as with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, further hospital adoption of quality improvement and compliance plans, and implementation in 2020 of its new incident reporting system, I-STAR, across all IHS Areas and facilities."

Before we could address Congress' broader concerns, we needed to assess how the 12 IHS Area Offices receive and disburse funds for services provided to Tribal members.  We chose to audit the Bemidji Area Office's (BAO's) procedures for disbursing IHS funds because it disburses funds to all program types., Our objectives were to determine the adequacy of BAO's procedures for (1) disbursing IHS funds to programs and (2) monitoring the programs' use of disbursed IHS funds., Our audit covered $512.0 million in FYs 2016 and 2017 IHS funds that BAO received and disbursed as allowances to programs within its geographic area.  Specifically, we reviewed the adequacy of (1) the procedures BAO had in place when it disbursed $394.6 million in FYs 2016 and 2017 in Health Service funds to IHS Direct, Tribal, and Urban programs within its geographic area and (2) BAO's monitoring of disbursed Health Service funds.  For the remaining $117.4 million, we confirmed that $75.9 million was recorded as FYs 2016 and 2017 Contract Support Cost funds and $41.5 million as FYs 2016 and 2017 Facilities funds., BAO generally had adequate procedures to disburse IHS funds to programs.

432,A-04-18-07075,Florida Received Unallowable Medicaid Reimbursement for School-Based Services A-04-18-07075 11-24-2020,"Florida school districts participating in Medicaid as providers certify quarterly that they have used non-Federal education funds for school-based services.  , Prior Office of Inspector General (OIG) audits identified significant overpayments to school districts for school-based services.  In those audits, we recommended that the States refund to the Federal Government the unallowable reimbursement that was claimed for the Medicaid school-based services. We performed this audit in Florida to determine whether the unallowable reimbursements we identified in other States also occurred in Florida., Our objective was to determine whether Florida claimed Federal Medicaid reimbursement for school-based services in accordance with Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered the top 15 school districts, which accounted for 73 percent or $12.2 million of the total amount paid by Florida.  We then selected a stratified random sample of 200 payments totaling $3,417 from a sampling frame of $11.8 million for review.  Using our sample results, we estimated the value of the unallowable payments made to school districts., Florida did not always claim Federal Medicaid reimbursement for school-based services in accordance with Federal and State requirements.  Of the 200 school-based services in our sample, 168 met Federal and State requirements.  However, Florida incorrectly claimed reimbursement for the remaining 32 sampled services totaling $644 because they did not meet one or more Federal requirements as follows: Individual Education Plans or Plans of Care without the required signature, not enough supporting documentation to substantiate services, and provider qualification requirements such as licenses and training courses missing. , These deficiencies occurred because Florida did not have formal policies and procedures to ensure that the claims school districts submitted were adequately documented.  In addition, Florida did not adequately monitor for compliance with Federal and State requirements school-based services claims that the school districts submitted., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Florida claimed at least $1.4 million in unallowable costs during our audit period., We recommend that Florida refund $1.4 million to the Federal Government, work with CMS to review Medicaid claims for school-based services after our audit period and refund any overpayments, and improve its policies and procedures to ensure that it is adequately monitoring school-based service claims to ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements. , In written comments on our draft report, Florida did not concur with our recommendations.  Florida said that it had a strong oversight process, but there were always opportunities for improvement and that it follows the guidance in the Handbook and works with the school districts to provide technical assistance and oversight.  In addition, Florida contended that we included claims data in the sampling frame for services not performed at the schools., We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  In addition, based on our discussions with Florida, we did not include claims within the sampling frame that contractors or community providers billed., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
433,A-02-20-01012,New Jersey's Medicaid School-Based Cost Settlement Process Could Result in Claims That Do Not Meet Federal Requirements A-02-20-01012 03-08-2022,"In July 2019, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) approved New Jersey's Medicaid Administrative Claiming and Special Education Medicaid Initiative Cost Settlement Process Guide (Process Guide).  New Jersey has been using the methodology detailed in the Process Guide to claim Medicaid school-based costs since October 2011.  In November 2019, OIG issued a report stating that the methodology did not meet Federal requirements.  As of December 2021, New Jersey is seeking to use the Process Guide to claim additional Medicaid reimbursement for school-based costs for prior periods if CMS approves a related proposal by New Jersey to amend its Medicaid State plan.  We initiated this audit because New Jersey has not corrected the deficiencies identified in our November 2019 report and seeks to use the Process Guide to claim additional funds for prior periods., The objective of our audit was to determine whether New Jersey's CMS-approved Process Guide complied with Federal requirements., To achieve our objective, we reviewed New Jersey's Process Guide and CMS's letter approving the Process Guide.  We also reviewed Federal requirements, CMS documents, and information provided by New Jersey., New Jersey's methodology for claiming Medicaid school-based costs, as described in the Process Guide, does not comply with Federal requirements.  Specifically, the Process Guide's methodology for conducting random moment time studies (RMTSs) (1) does not meet Federal requirements for statistical sampling, (2) defines one Medicaid administrative activity code as including activities not necessary for the administration of the Medicaid State plan, and (3) does not ensure that RMTS responses and Medicaid cost allocation ratios are supported.  In designing its Process Guide, New Jersey did not address deficiencies identified during our prior audit of its school-based program, follow CMS guidance, and ensure that its Medicaid cost allocation ratios could be supported.  Therefore, if CMS does not work with New Jersey to address the deficiencies identified in this report, Medicaid claims submitted for reimbursement by New Jersey school districts will not meet Federal requirements and the risk of improper payments could increase by tens of millions of dollars per year., We recommend that CMS direct New Jersey to revise the Process Guide to ensure that New Jersey's methodology for claiming Medicaid school-based health care services costs complies with Federal requirements.  The detailed recommendations are listed in the body of the report., In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendations.  CMS also indicated that it is in the process of developing updated guidance to ensure that time studies used by States to claim Medicaid Federal reimbursement for school-based administrative and health service programs are valid, reliable, and auditable. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

In 2016, more than 42,000 opioid-related overdose deaths occurred in the United States-115 deaths per day.  This data brief is part of a larger strategy by OIG to fight the opioid crisis and protect beneficiaries from prescription drug misuse and abuse.  This data brief provides 2017 data on the extent to which Medicare Part D beneficiaries receive extreme amounts of opioids or appear to be doctor shopping and compares these data to OIG's previous analysis of 2016.  It also identifies prescribers who have questionable opioid prescribing.  , We based this data brief on an analysis of Part D prescription drug event records for opioids received in 2017.  We determined beneficiaries' morphine equivalent dose (MED), which is a measure that converts all of the various opioids and strengths into one standard value., Ensuring the appropriate use and prescribing of opioids is essential to protecting the health and safety of beneficiaries and the integrity of Part D.  Prescribers play a key role in combatting opioid misuse.  They must be given the information and tools needed to appropriately prescribe opioids when medically necessary. , At the same time, the severity of the opioid crisis makes it imperative that HHS, including CMS and OIG, continues to work together to develop new strategies to address this epidemic.  As a part of these efforts, CMS is implementing a number of new initiatives in 2019.  OIG is also working to increase its efforts to fight the opioid crisis by working with our law enforcement partners and identifying other approaches to support prevention and treatment and to improve the effectiveness of broader Department efforts.  OIG is also committed to continue forging relationships with States and the private sector.  We encourage Part D sponsors to work with OIG and CMS to further improve efforts to combat opioid misuse, for example, by implementing their new ""lock in"" authority.  Further, we support States' efforts to implement and enforce strong prescriptions drug monitoring programs.  By working together and expanding our efforts in Part D, we can help curb the opioid crisis in our Nation."
435,OEI-05-18-00240,Part D Plans Generally Include Drugs Commonly Used by Dual Eligibles: 2018 Report (OEI-05-18-00240) 6-21-2018,"This report fulfills for 2018 the annual reporting mandate from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The ACA requires OIG to conduct a study of the extent to which formularies used by Medicare Part D plans include drugs commonly used by full benefit dual eligible individuals (i.e., individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits).  These individuals generally get drug coverage through Medicare Part D. Pursuant to the ACA, OIG must annually issue a report with recommendations as appropriate.  This is the seventh report the OIG has produced to meet this mandate., For this report, we determined whether the 386 unique formularies used by the 3,476 Part D plans operating in 2018 cover the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles.  We also determined the extent to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools to those commonly used drugs.  To create the list of the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles, we used the 2013 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey-the most recent data available at the time of our study.  Of the top 200 drugs, 197 are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage, 2 are excluded from coverage and 1 is a Part D covered medical supply item. , Overall, we found that the rate of Part D plan formularies' inclusion of the 197 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles is high, with some variation.  On average, Part D plan formularies include 96 percent of the 197 commonly used drugs.  In addition, 68 percent of the commonly used drugs are included by all Part D plan formularies.  These results are largely unchanged from OIG's findings for formularies reported in the mandated annual report from 2017, as well as our findings from 2011 through 2016., We also found that the percentage of drugs to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools increased slightly between 2017 and 2018.  On average, formularies applied utilization management tools to 29 percent of the unique drugs we reviewed in 2018, an increase of 1 percentage point from 2018., Inclusion rates for the 197 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles are largely unchanged compared with the inclusion rates listed in our previous reports.  Part D formularies include roughly the same high percentage of these commonly used drugs in 2018 as they did in 2017.  As mandated by the ACA, OIG will continue to monitor and produce annual reports on the extent to which Part D plan formularies cover drugs that dual eligibles commonly use.  In addition, OIG will continue to monitor Part D plan formularies' application of utilization management tools to these drugs.  OIG has no recommendations at this time."
436,A-01-18-02502,Pathways for Children Generally Complied With Health and Safety Requirements Audit (A-01-18-02502) 12-21-2018,"Pathways for Children, Inc. (Pathways), generally complied with Federal and State requirements by establishing systems of health and safety practices and management for ensuring the health and safety of children in its Head Start program.  While we observed instances of noncompliance with select Federal and State health and safety requirements, we did not observe a systemic problem throughout Pathways.  Pathways could improve its procedures to ensure children are kept safe at all times.  Specifically, we found that Pathways did not always ensure its (1) buildings and physical premises complied with Federal Head Start safety practices and State licensing standards, (2) employees received background checks as frequently as required, and (3) children received lead screening at the appropriate age., These deficiencies occurred because Pathways did not provide training on the identification of, and protection from, hazards within a building or around the facility premises; did not have a reliable system to set reminders and track when employees were due for renewed background checks; and did not adequately communicate with physicians' offices on children's age-appropriate lead screening., We recommended that Pathways (1) correct all instances of noncompliance that we observed; (2) strengthen its systems of health and safety practices and management; (3) utilize the output from a reliable system to ensure all employees complete background checks in the timing and frequency required by Federal regulations and State licensing standards; (4) conduct a review of the remaining child health records to verify that there is documentation from a healthcare professional showing that screening for lead poisoning was conducted annually as prescribed by State licensing standards; and (5) follow up during a child's enrollment process with the physician's office when evidence demonstrates the child had not received an age-appropriate lead screening and, if necessary, help parents schedule age-appropriate lead screening for their child., In written comments on our draft report, Pathways concurred with our findings and recommendations and provided information on actions that it had taken to address our recommendations."

Instead, the Head Start grant would be subject to an open competition.  In 2013, OHS notified Pathways for Children, Inc. (Pathways) that because of noncompliance with program requirements, it would be required to compete for Head Start funding.  Pathways applied to compete for the Head Start funding and was awarded the grant again as the sole applicant.  On the basis of its noncompliance, we selected Pathways for this audit., Our objective was to determine whether Pathways' Head Start program complied with Federal requirements., We reviewed $677,450 of the Head Start costs that Pathways claimed for the period May 11, 2016, through March 31, 2018.  These costs included nonstatistically selected direct, administrative, non-Federal share, and salary expenses.  We also reviewed written policies and evaluated various aspects of Pathway's management of its Head Start program., Pathways claimed some Head Start costs that did not meet Federal regulations.  Specifically, we found that Pathways did not meet its required non-Federal share match amount by $296,982 because it could not provide documentation that showed the expenses associated with Local Education Agencies (LEA) to provide Individualized Education Program (IEP) services to children enrolled at Pathways were allowable and because it claimed fundraising expenses for which the proceeds from the fundraising effort benefitted the entire organization and were not used for the sole purpose of meeting Head Start program objectives.  We also found that Pathways claimed $44,655 in Head Start capital expenditures for general purpose equipment without ACF's prior written approval., Pathways claimed unallowable non-Federal share expenses because it was not aware that LEAs billed other Federal sources for IEP services and it did not have policies and procedures in place to request documentation from LEAs as to whether LEAs billed other Federal sources.  Pathways claimed unallowable non-Federal share fundraising expenses in error because it (1) considered these expenses to be allowable non-Federal share expenses and (2) did not ensure that non-Federal share fundraising expenses were claimed in accordance with the relative benefits received.  In addition, Pathways did not request written prior approval for certain capital expenditures because it initially intended to fund the project using private funds., We recommend that Pathways (1) refund to the Federal Government $296,982 for fiscal year 2017 unallowable non-Federal share expenses or provide documentation showing that Federal sources were not billed for IEP services and (2) refund to the Federal Government $44,655 for fiscal year 2017 capital expenditures that lacked prior written approval from ACF and work with ACF to determine the amount of fiscal year 2016 Head Start funds that were drawn down without proper prior approval and refund that amount.

The purpose of QIPP is to encourage nursing facilities to improve the quality and innovation of their services.  Improvement is based on several quality measures that are collected by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).  Texas estimated that the total QIPP expenditures would be about $2.6 billion for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2018 through FY 2022.  The Social Security Act requires States to have methods and procedures to assure that Medicaid payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care., Our objective was to provide information about QIPP that CMS can use to determine whether it promotes economy and efficiency in the Medicaid program., We reviewed the flow of QIPP funds totaling $193.7 million ($110 million Federal share) during the first 6 months of the program (September 2017 through February 2018).  Our audit included an analysis of bank and accounting records from a judgmental sample of 10 nursing facilities participating in QIPP.  We also reviewed the CMS Five-Star Quality Ratings for nursing facilities that participated in QIPP to identify trends in the quality of nursing facility care., Certain aspects of QIPP raise questions about its ability to promote economy and efficiency in Medicaid.  Specifically: (1) nursing facilities received less than half of the earned incentive payments; (2) nursing facilities participating in QIPP generally rated below average in overall quality; (3) nursing facilities that declined in performance continued to receive quality improvement incentive payments; and (4) two local government entities participating in QIPP funded $1.3 million ($737,944 Federal share) of the non-Federal share of QIPP payments through intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) financed by means of debt instruments., QIPP provides some incentives for nursing facilities to improve the quality of resident care.  However, the results of our audit suggest that further analysis of the program is warranted., We recommend that CMS: (1) work with Texas to determine whether the source of IGTs and the practice of using debt instruments to fund the non-Federal share of QIPP payments meets program objectives and promotes economy and efficiency in Medicaid; and (2) reevaluate Texas' QIPP to ensure that it operates in a manner that meets program objectives while promoting economy and efficiency in Medicaid., Texas did not concur with our first recommendation and stated that there is no CMS regulation or policy, and no legal basis or precedent, for our position that IGTs were from an impermissible source.  While we acknowledge that Federal rules do not clearly indicate whether loans meet the definition of a permissible source for an IGT, we continue to have concerns that debt instruments, particularly when secured to ensure sufficient IGT funds, may not meet program objectives.  And given the impact that the use of debt instruments had on the timing of the nursing facilities receiving any of the earned incentive payments, we have concerns that the nursing facilities' ability to make improvements in quality could be impacted.  Texas did concur with our second recommendation., CMS concurred with our first recommendation, implied agreement with our second recommendation, and outlined actions it has taken and plans to take to address our findings and recommendations.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

We evaluated compliance with selected billing requirements. , The Hospital complied with Medicare billing requirements for 87 of the 145 inpatient and outpatient claims we audited.  However, the Hospital did not fully comply with Medicare billing requirements for the remaining 58 claims, resulting in net overpayments of $293,404 for the audit period.  Specifically, 49 inpatient claims had billing errors, resulting in overpayments of $284,753, and 9 outpatient claims had billing errors, resulting in overpayments of $8,651., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that the Hospital received overpayments of at least $2.1 million for the audit period., We recommend that the Hospital refund to the Medicare contractor $2.1 million in estimated overpayments for incorrectly billed services; exercise reasonable diligence to identify and return any additional similar overpayments received outside of our audit period, in accordance with the 60-day rule; and strengthen controls to ensure full compliance with Medicare requirements.

This information is based on published drug and biological pricing data and information submitted to CMS by manufacturers.  Additionally, we determined whether the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes were published in CMS's top-20 multiple-source drug listing.  HCPCS codes are used throughout the healthcare industry to standardize coding for medical procedures, services, products, and supplies., New York did not always comply with Federal Medicaid requirements for invoicing manufacturers for rebates for physician-administered drugs.  Specifically, New York did not invoice manufacturers for rebates associated with $3.3 million (Federal share) in single-source and top-20 multiple-source physician-administered drugs.  Although New York's policies and procedures require the collection of utilization data necessary to invoice for rebates on all claims, its internal controls did not always ensure that the data were used to invoice manufacturers to secure rebates. , Further, New York did not submit the drug utilization data necessary to secure rebates for claims associated with all other physician-administered drugs.  These drugs were included in claims totaling $2.3 million (Federal share) that did not have drug codes and in claims totaling $714,777 (Federal share) that contained drug codes., We recommend that New York refund to the Federal Government $3.3 million for single-source and top-20 multiple-source physician-administered drugs and work with CMS to determine the unallowable portion of the $3 million for other drug claims in question.  We also made a procedural recommendation., In written comments on our draft report, New York agreed with our recommended financial disallowance, partially agreed with our recommendation to work with CMS to determine the unallowable portion of the $3 million for other drug claims in question, and agreed with our procedural recommendation.  New York said that it believes it cannot obtain the drug codes for claims that are missing these codes because of the amount of time that has elapsed since the original date of service; therefore, it cannot invoice for these claims.  In addition, New York described corrective actions it has taken or planned to take to address our recommendations., After reviewing New York's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid and that New York should work with CMS to invoice for all physician-administered drugs eligible for rebates, including claims without drug codes., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
445,OEI-04-18-00230,Recommendation Followup:  Vulnerabilities Continue To Exist in the HHS Small Business Innovation Research Program Report  (OEI-04-18-00230) 3-20-2019,"We conducted this review to determine whether the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had addressed known vulnerabilities in its oversight of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to ensure that program funds were being spent appropriately.  In 2014, we reported vulnerabilities within HHS's SBIR program and made four recommendations to improve HHS's oversight.  HHS implemented two recommendations from our 2014 report prior to this review.  However, HHS had not formally notified OIG of any actions to implement the two outstanding recommendations-with which HHS had concurred-regarding awardee eligibility and duplicative funding.  Since implementation of the SBIR program in 1982, HHS has obligated or awarded nearly $13 billion in awards to small businesses pursuing innovative research ideas., To assess HHS's progress in implementing the two outstanding recommendations, we reviewed information from HHS regarding actions it had taken specific to these recommendations.  Specifically, we collected information from HHS to assess its current policies, procedures, and practices to ensure that awardees are eligible and that awards are not duplicative.  We determined the extent to which these policies, procedures, and/or practices addressed the vulnerabilities identified in the 2014 report and whether we should consider the two recommendations to be implemented. , Approximately 800 awardees received HHS SBIR funds in 2015 or 2016.  Of these awardees, we identified 32 as high risk and conducted further analysis to determine potential vulnerabilities.  To determine whether the two outstanding recommendations should be considered implemented, we weighed any improvements HHS made to its policies, procedures, and/or practices against any concerns that we identified in the award files and the significance of those concerns. , HHS has taken minimal action to improve policies and procedures for ensuring awardee eligibility and has taken no action to improve policies and procedures for preventing duplicative funding.  To better gauge the impact of these continued vulnerabilities, OIG conducted a risk assessment, and we identified 32 awardees as high risk.  We conducted further analysis on this small sample of awardees and determined that over two-thirds of them-22 of the 32 awardees that we found to be high risk-were potentially ineligible or potentially receiving duplicative funding.  Because of the significance of the vulnerabilities we identified, OIG and HHS initiated investigations or audits of over half of these awardees (13 of 22).  , The two outstanding OIG recommendations-regarding awardee eligibility and duplicative funding-remain unimplemented, and HHS's SBIR program continues to have weaknesses in these two areas.  To assist HHS in implementing these recommendations, we suggest a number of actions that the Department could take to address these weaknesses.  In response to this report, HHS stated that it considers both outstanding recommendations to be implemented because its policies and procedures are compliant with applicable requirements.  However, meeting the minimum requirements does not fulfill OIG's outstanding recommendations, nor does it appear that it sufficiently prevents fraud, waste, and abuse in the SBIR program."
446,A-04-18-04066,"Sleep Management, LLC: Audit of Claims for Monthly Rental of Noninvasive Home Ventilators A-04-18-04066 05-20-2021","A previous OIG review found that medical equipment suppliers could bill Medicare for a noninvasive home ventilator (NHV) as if it were being used as a ventilator, when use of a lower cost respiratory assist device or basic continuous positive airway pressure device was indicated by the patient's medical condition. , Sleep Management, LLC (Sleep Management), was among the top three suppliers of NHVs in calendar years (CYs) 2016 and 2017.  Medicare paid Sleep Management $36.8 million for NHVs during our audit period., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare claims submitted by Sleep Management for the monthly rental of NHVs complied with Medicare requirements., We selected a random sample of 100 claim lines for the monthly rental of NHVs submitted by Sleep Management that Medicare paid in CYs 2016 and 2017 (audit period).  An independent medical review contractor reviewed supporting documentation to determine whether the claim lines complied with Medicare coverage and payment requirements., Most Medicare claims submitted by Sleep Management for the monthly rental of NHVs did not comply with Medicare requirements.  Of the 100 sampled claim lines with payments totaling $75,694, 2 complied with Medicare requirements; however, 98 claim lines with payments totaling $74,288 did not.  Based on our sample results, we estimated that Medicare made overpayments to Sleep Management of at least $29.1 million for the monthly rental of NHVs that did not comply with Medicare requirements., These overpayments occurred because Sleep Management did not follow its policies and procedures to ensure that it obtained sufficient documentation to support the medical necessity of the NHV or discontinued service for lack of beneficiary usage. , We recommend that Sleep Management: (1) refund the portion of the estimated $29.1 million in Medicare overpayments for claim lines incorrectly billed that are within the 4-year reopening period; (2) exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any similar overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule; and (3) follow existing policies and procedures to help ensure that it complies with Medicare requirements. , Sleep Management did not concur with our recommendation to refund the estimated overpayments contending that: (1) its NHV claims were medically necessary, (2) we applied clinical standards not required by CMS and improperly applied clinical guidance, (3) our sampling methodology and extrapolation were improper, (4) our medical reviewer was not independent, and (5) it was not liable for the overpayments.  Additionally, Sleep Management stated that it recognized its responsibility under the 60-day rule and had exercised more than reasonable diligence in determining and quantifying any overpayments owed as a result of this audit.  Finally, Sleep Management did not concur with our recommendation to follow its existing policies and procedures to ensure compliance with Medicare requirements maintaining that its compliance programs were adequate. , After reviewing Sleep Management's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  However, to avoid potential confusion, we removed a finding related to a beneficiary's continued need for an NHV.  Removing this finding did not change our estimated overpayments or recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Preliminary work reviewing one provider's compliance identified broader, significant concerns with Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations; therefore, we determined that an audit of CMS's Medicare cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation programs could identify potential areas for improvement and reduce provider errors as well as result in monetary savings. , Our objective was to determine whether CMS regulatory requirements contained sufficient information to ensure that claims for outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services complied with Medicare coverage requirements., We selected for review the third highest-paid provider in the country in combined Medicare reimbursement for both outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services.  We reviewed a random sample of 100 beneficiary-days.  We submitted 10 beneficiary-days to an independent medical review contractor and evaluated all 100 beneficiary-days for compliance with applicable requirements and to determine whether services complied with Medicare coverage and documentation requirements., CMS regulatory requirements related to Medicare outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services did not contain sufficient information to ensure that claims for these services met Medicare coverage requirements.  Specifically, the requirements lacked details related to what patient-specific information should be contained in a beneficiary's medical record and how this information should relate to their individualized treatment.  As a result, for all 100 sampled beneficiary-days, we determined that medical record documentation obtained from the selected provider did not contain sufficient evidence to support whether Medicare coverage requirements for reimbursement of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services were met.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that $2.7 million in Medicare payments made by CMS to the selected provider for outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services may not have met Medicare coverage requirements, as intended.  Further, based on our review, we believe that Medicare payments totaling approximately $626 million made by CMS to all providers for outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services during our audit period may not have met the requirements., We recommend that CMS revise its regulations to provide sufficient guidance to ensure that providers meet coverage requirements for outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services., In written comments on our draft report, CMS stated that, in March 2021, it updated subregulatory guidance in two of its manuals to more closely reflect regulatory text.  CMS also stated that it will consider our recommendation when determining appropriate next steps regarding the regulations on outpatient cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation services., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

A prior Office of Inspector General (OIG) report indicated that this is a low estimate., Our objective was to determine the impact on Medicaid drug rebates from including authorized generic drug transactions in the brand name drugs' AMP calculations., Our review covered nine brand name drugs that included authorized generic drugs to secondary manufacturers in their AMP calculations.  The nine brand name drugs included 40 nine-digit national drug codes that made up approximately 45 percent of the total Medicaid dollars reimbursed for drugs with authorized generics for 2017., After the manufacturers provided the AMP data for each drug, we verified the data, removed the authorized generic transactions, and recalculated the AMP.  Next, we recalculated rebate amounts based on the recalculated AMP.  We compared the recalculated rebates to the original rebates to determine the impact on Medicaid rebate amounts for the nine drugs., By including authorized generic drug transactions to secondary manufacturers in the brand name drug's AMP calculations, Medicaid received 46 percent less in rebates than it otherwise would have for the nine brand name drugs we reviewed, amounting to $595 million for calendar year 2017., We recommend that CMS seek legislative change to exclude authorized generic drug transactions to secondary manufacturers from the AMP calculation of the brand name drug, which may increase manufacturer Medicaid rebate obligations by hundreds of millions each year., CMS concurred with our recommendation.  CMS stated that it informs HHS of OIG recommendations for legislative change through the development of the President's Budget.  CMS noted the President's Fiscal Year 2020 Budget includes a legislative proposal to exclude the authorized generic sales from the primary manufacturer's average price., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
449,OEI-04-18-00080,Selected Health Care Coalitions Increased Involvement in Whole Community Preparedness But Face Developmental Challenges Following New Requirements in 2017 OEI-04-18-00080 04-29-2020,"Health care coalitions (HCCs) help prepare their community health care systems to respond to public health emergencies, such as natural disasters.  HCCs are member-led and are composed of health care entities and other response entities that voluntarily work together to coordinate an emergency response.  ASPR supports HCCs through the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP).  The HPP funds awardees (e.g., States) to create HCCs, oversee HCCs, and fund HCC activities.  In 2017, the HPP required HCCs to include four core member types (hospitals, public health, emergency medical services, and emergency management) and other diverse, ancillary member types (e.g., long-term-care facilities, home health agencies) that are critical to addressing the unique preparedness needs of HCCs' respective communities.  Additionally, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) suggested that health care entities join HCCs as one way to meet Medicare's emergency preparedness Conditions of Participation, with which CMS required compliance starting November 2017., This is not a review of the Federal, State, or local government response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency., We selected a purposive sample of 20 HCCs and the corresponding 20 HPP awardees that received 2017 HPP funding.  We conducted interviews, administered surveys, and collected documentation from each HCC and HPP awardee.  We analyzed responses and documentation to determine the extent to which HCCs expanded their membership; to identify HCC benefits and challenges for coordinating with members; and to determine the extent to which ASPR requirements and guidance facilitate HCCs' and HPP awardees' ability to increase whole community preparedness.  , Nearly all 20 HCCs in our review have expanded their membership since ASPR and CMS implemented new preparedness requirements.  According to most of these HCCs, this expansion was driven primarily by new diverse types of entities seeking to meet the CMS emergency preparedness Conditions of Participation.  Further, all selected HCCs reported that their members take part in HCC activities that benefit whole community emergency preparedness.  , However, HCCs also reported that expanded membership presents challenges.  For example, some HCCs reported adding new ancillary members in ways that were not strategic.  Further, many HCCs reported concentrating their limited resources on developmental activities for these new ancillary members, thereby lessening resources available for other HCC priorities.  Moreover, HCCs expressed concerns about their ability to continue to incentivize core members' participation in HCC activities., Additionally, while HCCs and HPP awardees generally found ASPR guidance beneficial, we found that some HPP requirements and ASPR guidance are not clear.  Specifically, unclear requirements and guidance included (1) how an HCC should strategically grow membership, and (2) the flexibility that ASPR allows in meeting HPP membership and other requirements.  This lack of clarity contributes to HCCs' challenges and may limit HCCs' ability to prepare for a whole community response to a range of public health emergencies, including emerging infectious diseases.  , To further improve HCCs' preparedness for a whole community emergency response, ASPR should (1) clarify guidance that HCCs' membership should ensure strategic, comprehensive coverage of their communities' gaps in preparedness and response; (2) continue to work with CMS to help health care entities comply with the CMS emergency preparedness Conditions of Participation; (3) identify ways to incentivize core members' participation; and (4) clarify to HPP awardees the flexibility available in meeting requirements.  ASPR concurred with all four recommendations."

453,OEI-09-16-00411,Some Medicare Part D Beneficiaries Face Avoidable Extra Steps That Can Delay or Prevent Access to Prescribed Drugs Report  (OEI-09-16-00411) 9-18-2019,"This evaluation examines data and oversight related to Part D pharmacy rejections and coverage denials that, when issued for avoidable or inappropriate reasons, can lead to delays in beneficiary access to needed drugs.  Part D is an optional benefit that helps beneficiaries pay for medically necessary prescription drugs.  However, Part D's shared-risk payment model can create an incentive for sponsors to deny requests for prescription drugs in an attempt to increase profits.  Because Part D covers more than 45 million beneficiaries, even low rates of denied or delayed medically necessary drugs or reimbursement could contribute to physical or financial harm for Medicare beneficiaries., For each Part D contract, we collected 2017 data on pharmacy rejections related to formulary and utilization management requirements and on coverage denials, appeals, and appeal outcomes.  We calculated applicable volumes and rates.  We also analyzed data from the independent entities that review the higher levels of Part D appeals.  To examine CMS audit findings, we analyzed the 2017 results for the Part D program audits and the related enforcement actions, and 2017 data from the formulary administration analysis.  We also examined CMS websites to determine the location of information about sponsor performance., Ideally, a Medicare beneficiary would be prescribed only medically necessary drugs, and would obtain any required preapprovals or exceptions before visiting a pharmacy so that prescriptions could be filled without extra steps.  However, in 2017, Part D insurance companies (""sponsors"") rejected millions of prescriptions presented at pharmacies, and overturned a large number of drug-coverage denials when beneficiaries appealed.  This pattern indicates that the ideal scenario does not always occur.  , In 2017, sponsors' automated systems rejected millions of prescriptions that beneficiaries tried to fill at pharmacies.  Some of these rejections could have been avoided if the prescribed drugs were on the approved drug lists, met requirements, or received any required preapprovals.  Although sponsors should reject prescriptions that do not meet requirements, the affected beneficiaries may still have needed medications and may have filed coverage requests, paid out of pocket, or contacted their providers to request different drugs.  These extra steps can delay beneficiaries' access to needed drugs, or deter them from getting them if they are unable or unwilling to navigate the process.  , After receiving rejections at pharmacies, beneficiaries can file coverage requests, and if those are denied, they can appeal.  Among coverage denials that beneficiaries appealed in 2017, sponsors fully overturned or partially overturned 73 percent.  These overturned denials could have been avoided if sponsors had received, and correctly processed, all relevant information at the first request.  , Through its oversight efforts, CMS has determined that sponsors sometimes inappropriately rejected or denied pharmacy and drug coverage requests.  These errors led to inappropriate denials or delays of beneficiary access to prescribed drugs., We recommend that CMS (1) take additional steps to improve electronic communication between Part D sponsors and prescribers to reduce avoidable pharmacy rejections and coverage denials; (2) take action to reduce inappropriate pharmacy rejections; (3) take action to reduce inappropriate coverage denials; and (4) provide beneficiaries with clear, easily accessible information about sponsor performance problems, including those related to inappropriate pharmacy rejections and coverage denials.  CMS concurred with all four recommendations."
454,A-09-18-03031,CMS Could Have Saved $192 Million by Targeting Home Health Claims for Review With Visits Slightly Above the Threshold That Triggers a Higher Medicare Payment A-09-18-03031 07-22-2020,"Under the prospective payment system (PPS), Medicare pays home health agencies (HHAs) for each 60 day episode of care that beneficiary receives, called a payment episode.  During our audit period, if an HHA provided four or fewer visits in a payment episode, Medicare paid the HHA a standardized per-visit payment.  Claims for these types of payments are called Low Utilization Payment Adjustment (LUPA) claims.  Once a fifth visit was provided during the payment episode (i.e., above the LUPA threshold), Medicare paid an amount for the services provided that was, in general, substantially higher than the per-visit payment amount.  Because of the large payment increase starting with the fifth visit, HHAs have an incentive to improperly bill claims with visits slightly above the LUPA threshold., Our objective was to determine whether payments for home health services with five to seven visits in a payment episode complied with Medicare requirements. , Our audit covered $1.25 billion in Medicare payments to HHAs for claims for home health services provided in 2017 (audit period).  We selected a stratified random sample of 120 HHA claims with 5, 6, or 7 visits in a payment episode.  An independent medical review contractor determined whether the services met medical necessity and coding requirements., Not all payments to HHAs for home health services with five to seven visits in a payment episode complied with Medicare requirements.  Of the 120 sampled claims we reviewed, 91 complied with requirements, and for 4 claims there was no documentation available to make a compliance determination.  However, the remaining 25 claims did not comply with requirements.  As a result, Medicare improperly paid HHAs for a portion of the payment episode (14 claims) and for the full payment episode (11 claims), totaling $41,613.  These improper payments occurred because the Medicare administrative contractors (MACs) did not analyze claim data or perform risk assessments to target for additional review those claims with visits slightly above the LUPA threshold of four visits.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Medicare overpaid HHAs nationwide $191.8 million for our audit period. , In November 2018 (after our audit period), the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized a new home health PPS methodology, effective for home health periods of care beginning on or after January 1, 2020.  This new methodology revised the LUPA threshold from four visits to a threshold varying from two to six visits.  The majority of the claims in our sample (20 of 25) that did not comply with Medicare requirements under the previous PPS methodology would also have not complied with those requirements under the new methodology.  , We recommend that CMS: (1) direct the MACs to recover the $41,613 in identified overpayments made to HHAs for the sampled claims; (2) require the MACs to perform data analysis and risk assessments of claims with visits slightly above the applicable LUPA threshold and target these claims for additional review; and (3) instruct the MACs to educate HHA providers on properly billing for home health services with visits slightly above the applicable LUPA threshold, which could have saved Medicare as much as $191.8 million during our audit period., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions that it had taken or planned to take to address the recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Video: Medicare Advantage Denials of Care</img></a>, <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/newsroom/news-releases-articles/employee-profile-rosemary-bartholomew/"">Employee Profile: Rosemary Bartholomew</a>, A central concern about the capitated payment model used in Medicare Advantage is the potential incentive for Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) to deny beneficiary access to services and deny payments to providers in an attempt to increase profits.  Although MAOs approve the vast majority of requests for services and payment, they issue millions of denials each year, and CMS annual audits of MAOs have highlighted widespread and persistent problems related to inappropriate denials of services and payment.  As Medicare Advantage enrollment continues to grow, MAOs play an increasingly critical role in ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to medically necessary covered services and that providers are reimbursed appropriately., We selected a stratified random sample of 250 prior authorization denials and 250 payment denials issued by 15 of the largest MAOs during June 1-7, 2019.  Health care coding experts conducted case file reviews of all cases, and physician reviewers examined medical records for a subset of cases.  From these results, we estimated the rates at which MAOs denied prior authorization and payment requests that met Medicare coverage and MAO billing rules.  We also examined the reasons that these denials occurred and the types of services associated with these denials in our sample., Our case file reviews determined that MAOs sometimes delayed or denied Medicare Advantage beneficiaries' access to services, even though the requests met Medicare coverage rules.  MAOs also denied payments to providers for some services that met both Medicare coverage rules and MAO billing rules.  Denied requests that meet Medicare coverage rules may prevent or delay beneficiaries from receiving medically necessary care and can burden providers.  Although some of the denials that we reviewed were ultimately reversed by the MAOs, avoidable delays and extra steps create friction in the program and may create an administrative burden for beneficiaries, providers, and MAOs.  Examples of health care services involved in denials that met Medicare coverage rules included advanced imaging services (e.g., MRIs) and post-acute facility stays (e.g., inpatient rehabilitation). , Prior authorization requests.  We found that, among the prior authorization requests that MAOs denied, 13 percent met Medicare coverage rules; in other words, these services likely would have been approved for these beneficiaries under original Medicare (also known as Medicare fee-for-service).  We identified two common causes of these denials.  First, MAOs used clinical criteria that are not contained in Medicare coverage rules (e.g., requiring an x-ray before approving more advanced imaging), which led them to deny requests for services that our physician reviewers determined were medically necessary.  Although our review determined that the requests in these cases did meet Medicare coverage rules, CMS guidance is not sufficiently detailed to determine whether MAOs may deny authorization based on internal MAO clinical criteria that go beyond Medicare coverage rules. , Second, MAOs indicated that some prior authorization requests did not have enough documentation to support approval, yet our reviewers found that the existing beneficiary medical records were sufficient to support the medical necessity of the services.  , Payment requests.  We found that, among the payment requests that MAOs denied, 18 percent of the requests met Medicare coverage rules and MAO billing rules.  Most of these payment denials in our sample were caused by human error during manual claims processing reviews (e.g., overlooking a document) and system processing errors (e.g., the MAO's system was not programmed or updated correctly).  , We also found that MAOs reversed some of the denied prior authorization and payment requests that met Medicare coverage and MAO billing rules.  Often the reversals occurred when a beneficiary or provider appealed or disputed the denial, and in some cases MAOs identified their own errors., Our findings about the causes and circumstances under which MAOs denied prior authorization or payment for requests that met Medicare coverage and MAO billing rules provide an opportunity for improvement to ensure that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have timely access to all necessary health care services, and that providers are paid appropriately.  Therefore, we recommend that CMS: "

These checks can prevent individuals with disqualifying histories (e.g., convictions for patient abuse, patient neglect, and theft from patients) from being hired to care for beneficiaries.  The National Background Check Program (Program) provides grants to States to develop systems to conduct background checks of State and Federal criminal history records for prospective long-term-care employees., Congress mandates that OIG evaluate various aspects of Program implementation.  This report provides an assessment of 11 of the 12 States that concluded Program participation in 2017 and 2018.  (The 12th State did not submit closeout documents in time to be included in this study.)  This report also provides information for CMS to assist other States that continue to participate in the Program.  Seven States had ongoing grants after the reviewed closeout period.  In future work, we will assess these States and the overall Program., We reviewed grant-monitoring documents and financial reports to determine the extent to which 11 States that concluded participation between 2017 and 2018 had implemented 13 selected Program requirements.  Additionally, we surveyed the 11 States to collect information on their experiences with their respective background check programs., The 11 States that concluded their participation in the Program in 2017 and 2018 varied as to the degree to which they were able to implement Program requirements.  Two States implemented all selected Program requirements.  Nine States did not implement all the selected Program requirements, primarily because of a lack of legislative authority for certain Program requirements.  Five of these nine States implemented most of the selected Program requirements; four of the nine States implemented only some of the selected Program requirements., Of the background checks conducted, over 25,000 resulted in determinations of ineligibility for prospective employees.  The number of determinations of ineligibility varied among the States, as did the rates of determinations of ineligibility (from 0 percent to 3 percent).  None of the States provided evidence of unintended consequences associated with conducting background checks, such as a reduction in the available workforce for long-term-care facilities or providers., The findings of this report are consistent with our previous assessments of the Program and provide further support for one open OIG recommendation.  We strongly encourage the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to implement this open recommendation:  take appropriate actions to encourage States to obtain the necessary legislative authority to fully implement Program requirements.  We are not offering any new recommendations at this time."

458,OEI-02-15-00451,ACOs' Strategies for Transitioning to Value-Based Care: Lessons From the Medicare Shared Savings Program Report  (OEI-02-15-00451) 07-19-2019,"Medicare spending is expected to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2028, more than double the $708 billion in spending in 2017.  To help control Medicare spending, while promoting high-quality healthcare, CMS has been implementing alternative payment models that reward providers for the quality and value of services.  This is part of the transition away from fee-for-service to value-based care. , The Medicare Shared Savings Program is part of this transition and is one of the largest alternative payment models.  In this program, healthcare providers voluntarily form Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) to coordinate care to reduce spending and improve quality of care.  Their strategies can inform not only current and future ACOs but also other alternative payment models., We based this study on a purposive sample of 20 high-performing ACOs.  These ACOs had reductions in Medicare spending and provided high-quality care.  We conducted structured onsite or telephone interviews with key officials from each of these ACOs.  We also analyzed supplemental documentation provided by these ACOs., As part of the transition to value-based care, Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs have developed a number of strategies to reduce Medicare spending and improve quality of care.  This report describes the strategies that selected ACOs have found successful in reducing spending and improving quality of care.  These strategies involve working to increase cost awareness in ACO physicians, engaging beneficiaries to improve their own health, and managing beneficiaries with costly or complex care needs to improve their health outcomes.  Other strategies that ACOs found successful involve reducing avoidable hospitalizations, controlling costs and improving quality in skilled nursing and home healthcare, addressing behavioral health needs and social determinants of health, and using technology to increase information sharing among providers.  ACOs also reported challenges in each of these areas and describe ways they overcame them., CMS recently made changes to the Shared Savings Program.  As CMS carries out this and other ACO programs and develops new alternative payment models, it should support the use of these strategies and other successful strategies that emerge.  These strategies can apply not only to ACOs but also to other providers committed to transforming the healthcare system toward value., On the basis of the experiences of the selected ACOs, we recommend that CMS take the following actions to support efforts to reduce unnecessary spending and improve quality of care for patients: (1) review the impact of programmatic changes on ACOs' ability to promote value-based care; (2) expand efforts to share information about strategies that reduce spending and improve quality among ACOs and more widely with the public; (3) adopt outcome-based measures and better align measures across programs; (4) assess and share information about ACOs' use of the skilled nursing facility 3-day rule waiver and apply these results when making changes to the Shared Savings Program or other programs; (5) identify and share information about strategies that integrate physical and behavioral health services and address social determinants of health; (6) identify and share information about strategies that encourage patients to share behavioral health data; and (7) prioritize ACO referrals of potential fraud, waste, and abuse.  CMS concurred with all of our recommendations."
459,OEI-09-18-00430,The Office of Refugee Resettlement's Incident Reporting System Is Not Effectively Capturing Data To Assist Its Efforts To Ensure the Safety of Minors in HHS Custody OEI-09-18-00430 06-17-2020,"The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), has custody of and must provide care to minors (children younger than 18 years of age) in the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Program.  ORR is responsible for providing a safe environment for all minors in the program.  In recent years, ORR-funded facilities have reported allegations of sexual and physical abuse of minors in their care, some resulting in criminal convictions.  , OIG analyzed Significant Incident Reports (SIRs) submitted to ORR by 45 ORR funded facilities between January 1, 2018, and July 31, 2018, to identify any challenges for the oversight of facilities to ensure the safety of children.  In addition, we conducted an in-depth review of incident reports that described conduct of a sexual nature.  This allowed us to provide information about these types of potentially egregious incidents and ORR's response to them.  We could not determine whether the incidents were officially investigated or substantiated by an external agency, on the basis of the information in the reports.  We also identified challenges in the SIR reporting process for oversight of facilities to ensure the safety of children.  This assessment is based on our review of the SIRs and information gathered during OIG's site visits at the 45 facilities in August and September 2018.  At each facility, we conducted interviews with key staff responsible for ensuring the safety of minors.  We also interviewed the 28 ORR Federal field specialists assigned to the facilities and reviewed relevant policies and procedures. , We reviewed incident reports that 45 care provider facilities submitted to ORR between January 1, 2018, and July 31, 2018.  Among these reports, 761 unique incidents described conduct of a sexual nature.  Reports for most (704) of these incidents involved conduct between minors, fewer (48) involved conduct by an adult against a minor, and the remaining (9) incidents had an unknown perpetrator.  The incidents varied widely in type and severity.  For example, the conduct described in these incidents included a minor opening a bathroom door while another minor was inside as well as a staff member kissing a minor.  ORR's incident reporting system lacks designated fields to capture information that ORR can use to oversee facilities and to protect the minors in ORR care.  Important information about facilities' actions are not systematically collected to help ORR determine whether facilities responded appropriately to incidents.  In addition, the system does not effectively capture information in a way that allows for efficient identification of issues that require immediate attention and analysis to detect concerning trends.  Further, facilities described challenges with staffing youth care workers-who are essential to preventing, detecting, and reporting incidents-and difficulties determining which incidents should be reported to ORR., Our recommendations aim to improve the incident reporting system and reduce the challenges that facilities face.  ACF should work with ORR to (1) systematically collect key information about incidents that allows for efficient and effective oversight, (2) track and trend incident report information to identify opportunities to better safeguard minors, (3) work with facilities to address staffing shortages of youth care workers, and (4) improve its guidance to help facilities consistently identify and report significant incidents.  ACF concurred with all four of our recommendations."
460,A-09-18-03026,Medicare Could Have Saved Millions of Dollars in Payments for Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy Planning Services Audit (A-09-18-03026) 06-13-2019,"Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) allows doctors to sculpt radiation beams to the shape of a patient's tumor. Medicare makes a single payment to hospitals for development of a 3D-CRT treatment plan. Automated prepayment edits generally prevent additional payments for separately billed radiation planning services if they are billed on the same date of service as the 3D-CRT treatment plan. However, Medicare billing requirements do not prohibit and system edits do not prevent additional payments if the services are billed on a different date of service (e.g., 1 to 14 days before). , Our objective was to determine the potential savings to Medicare if billing requirements and system edits had been implemented to prevent additional payments for separately billed 3D-CRT planning services. , From calendar years (CYs) 2008 through 2017, Medicare made $576.9 million in payments to 1,454 hospitals for development of 3D-CRT treatment plans. We matched payments for separately billed radiation planning services against these payments and identified an additional $125.4 million in payments made to 1,379 of these hospitals. These services were billed up to 14 days before the procedure code for the 3D-CRT treatment plan was billed by the same hospital for the same beneficiary., Medicare could have saved $125.4 million from CYs 2008 through 2017 by implementing billing requirements and system edits to prevent additional payments for separately billed 3D-CRT planning services. These services were primarily billed on a different date of service from the procedure code for development of a 3D-CRT treatment plan. As of January 9, 2019, Medicare had paid $13.6 million for separately billed 3D-CRT planning services performed in CY 2018. , For a form of radiation therapy similar to 3D-CRT, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), Medicare makes a bundled payment to hospitals to cover a range of radiation planning services that may be performed to develop an IMRT treatment plan. Medicare billing requirements prohibit and system edits prevent additional payments for separately billed planning services, regardless of when they are billed. The billing requirements have been in effect since January 1, 2008; the system edits have been in effect since April 1, 2018 (as the result of a prior OIG review). Our finding reflects how much Medicare could have saved if similar billing requirements and system edits had been implemented for 3D-CRT when the billing requirements for IMRT went into effect. , We recommend that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) implement billing requirements (including, for example, a bundled payment similar to that for IMRT) and system edits to prevent additional payments for 3D-CRT planning services that are billed before (e.g., up to 14 days before) the procedure code for the 3D-CRT treatment plan is billed, which could have saved Medicare as much as $125.4 million during CYs 2008 through 2017 and as much as $13.6 million in CY 2018. , CMS concurred with our recommendation and stated that it will consider whether implementing billing requirements in the future to prevent payments for additional planning services when reported with 3D-CRT would be appropriate., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
461,A-02-18-02010,HRSA's Monitoring Did Not Always Ensure Health Centers' Compliance With Federal Requirements for HRSA's Access Increases In Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Supplemental Grant Funding A-02-18-02010 07-21-2020,"In 2017, HHS declared the opioid epidemic in the United States a public health emergency.  The misuse of and addiction to opioids-including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl-is a serious national crisis that affects public health as well as social and economic welfare.  In 2018 alone, there were more than 46,000 opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States.  As part of its efforts to combat the opioid crisis, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded $200.5 million in Access Increases in Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (AIMS) grants to health centers nation-wide.  OIG audited HRSA's oversight of AIMS supplemental grant funding as part of our oversight on the integrity and proper stewardship of Federal funds used to combat the opioid crisis., Our objective was to determine whether HRSA followed its policies and procedures for awarding and monitoring AIMS grants., HRSA awarded AIMS supplemental grant funds totaling $200.5 million to 1,178 health centers for the period September 1, 2017, through August 31, 2018.  From the 1,178 health centers, we selected a nonstatistical sample of 30 health centers to determine whether HRSA followed its policies and procedures for awarding and monitoring AIMS grants., HRSA followed its policies and procedures for awarding AIMS grants but did not always follow its policies and procedures when monitoring health centers' compliance with supplemental funding requirements.  Specifically, HRSA did not follow its policies and procedures when monitoring health centers' progress toward meeting AIMS grant award conditions related to ongoing and one-time funding and did not always respond timely to health centers' requests to carry over grant funds.  HRSA officials stated that monitoring of health centers' progress toward meeting AIMS supplemental funding requirements is done in conjunction with its general monitoring of health centers through annual reviews.  According to HRSA officials, HRSA did not always respond timely to health centers' requests to carry over grant funds because of other priorities, such as awarding other grants to health centers.	, We recommend that HRSA (1) assess health centers' progress toward meeting AIMS grant award conditions to increase personnel and patients' access to care and follow up with appropriate corrective action, such as providing technical assistance or discontinuing or reducing future AIMS grant funds; (2) review Budget Period Progress Reports to identify health centers that did not report progress toward meeting their health information technology or training goals; and (3) ensure that it follows its policy for timely responding to health centers' requests to carry over grant funds. , In written comments on our draft report, HRSA partially concurred with our findings and recommendations and described actions that it has taken or plans to take to address them.  This includes reducing or discontinuing ongoing AIMS funding for certain health centers, developing electronic systems to collect interim progress reports (e.g., tri-annual reporting) to support more timely monitoring of AIMS funding, and monitoring its responsiveness to prior approval requests., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/hrsa.asp"">Health Resources and Services Administration</a>"
462,A-09-18-01007,SAMHSA's Oversight of Accreditation Bodies for Opioid Treatment Programs Did Not Comply With Some Federal Requirements A-09-18-01007 03-06-2020,"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) estimated that, in 2017, 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers.  Medication-assisted treatment (MAT), provided by opioid treatment programs (OTPs), combines the use of medications with other therapies to treat opioid use disorders.  Federal regulations established an oversight system for the treatment of substance use disorders with MAT.  OTPs must be certified by SAMHSA and accredited by a SAMHSA-approved accreditation body.  We reviewed SAMHSA's oversight of the accreditation bodies because the adequacy of that oversight affects the safety of patients and the public., Our objective was to determine whether SAMHSA's oversight of accreditation bodies complied with Federal requirements., We reviewed SAMHSA's activities in overseeing accreditation bodies.  Specifically, we reviewed the results of SAMHSA's inspections performed at selected OTPs from October 2016 through September 2018 (audit period) and a judgmental sample of 30 reports for accreditation surveys conducted by accreditation bodies during our audit period.  We also requested documentation of SAMHSA's evaluations of accreditation elements., SAMHSA performed inspections at selected OTPs but did not (1) meet its goal for the number of OTPs it would inspect, (2) take actions to address accreditation bodies' noncompliance with survey requirements, or (3) determine whether OTPs complied with the Federal standards when patient charts were incomplete.  In addition, SAMHSA reviewed accreditation bodies' survey reports, but the reports were inconsistent and did not contain sufficient information to determine whether the OTPs met the Federal standards.  Finally, SAMHSA's evaluations of accreditation bodies' accreditation elements were not documented or retained.  (An example of an accreditation element would be accredited OTPs' commitment to continually improving their organizations and service delivery to the people served.)  Without improved oversight and proper documentation of its evaluations, SAMHSA may not be able to adequately evaluate the performance of accreditation bodies and ensure that OTPs are meeting the Federal opioid treatment standards.  , We recommend that SAMHSA (1) identify steps it can take and take action to ensure that it meets its goal for the number of OTPs it inspects each year and (2) review the results of its inspections and take action to address accreditation bodies' noncompliance with survey requirements.  The report also lists three more procedural recommendations., SAMHSA concurred with all of our recommendations and provided specific information on actions that it planned to take to address two of our recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/samhsa.asp"">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>"

In July 2008, mail-order diabetes test strips became part of the Competitive Bidding Program in certain limited areas, and in July 2013, this was expanded to include a National Mail-Order Program for diabetes testing supplies.  The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) prohibits CMS from awarding contracts in the National Mail-Order Program to a supplier of diabetes test strips if the supplier's bid does not cover at least 50 percent, by volume, of all types of diabetes test strips provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  (This is known as the ""50 percent rule."")  MIPPA requires OIG to determine the market shares of the types of diabetes test strips before each round of bidding to assist CMS in ensuring that bidding suppliers meet the 50-percent rule.  , Initially, OIG based its calculations of the Medicare market shares on claims data for diabetes test strips supplied via mail order by Competitive Bidding Program suppliers.  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the 50-percent rule by requiring analysis of diabetes test strips supplied via mail order as well as via non-mail order for bids to furnish diabetes test strips after December 31, 2018.  A second report, anticipated in early 2019, will determine the market shares for diabetes test strips provided via non-mail order (i.e., from local pharmacies or supplier storefronts).  These evaluations will inform future round(s) of the Competitive Bidding Program for diabetes test strips.  All Competitive Bidding Program contracts expired on December 31, 2018, and new contracts are not expected before December 31, 2020., We determined the Medicare market shares for diabetes test strips types associated with a simple random sample of Medicare claims for the 3-month period of April 1, 2018, through June 30, 2018.  Our sample of 1,210 claims was drawn from a population of 313,704 claims for diabetes test strips provided by mail order to Medicare beneficiaries.  To estimate the Medicare market shares, we surveyed suppliers and projected our sample data to the population of diabetes test strips provided by mail order during the timeframe we reviewed., From April through June 2018, sampled suppliers provided 17 types of diabetes test strips via the Medicare National Mail-Order Program.  The top 2 strip types accounted for 53 percent of the Medicare mail-order market, and the top 10 strip types accounted for 98 percent of the market."

MIPPA requires OIG to determine the market shares of the types of diabetes test strips before each round of competitive bidding to assist CMS in ensuring that bidding suppliers meet the 50-percent rule.  Initially, compliance with the 50 percent rule was assessed using mail order claims only.  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the 50-percent rule by requiring that, for bids on or after January 1, 2019, CMS must use data from the non-mail order Medicare market as well as the mail-order one.  Since 2010, OIG has been conducting evaluations of the Medicare market shares of diabetes test strips provided via mail order.

CMS replaced payment rates with new rates based on charges in the private health care market.  This is the first reform in 3 decades to Medicare's payment system for lab tests.  As part of the same legislation reforming Medicare's payment system, Congress mandated that OIG monitor Medicare payments for lab tests and the implementation and effect of the new payment system for those tests.  This data brief provides the fourth set of annual baseline analyses of the top 25 lab tests., We analyzed claims data for lab tests that CMS paid for under Medicare's Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule.  These tests are covered under Medicare Part B, and do not include tests that Medicare paid for under other payment systems, such as the payment system for critical access hospitals or the Outpatient Prospective Payment System.  We identified the top 25 tests based on Medicare payments in 2017.  We also identified key statistics and emerging trends, including Medicare payments by procedure code, beneficiary, lab, ordering provider, and test category., Medicare paid $7.1 billion under Part B for lab tests in 2017, a total that has changed very little in the 4-year period from 2014 through 2017.  The top 25 tests by Medicare payments totaled $4.5 billion and represented 64 percent of all Medicare payments for lab tests in 2017.  The top five tests, which remained consistent with the top five from the previous 3 years, totaled $2.2 billion in 2017., Although more than 50,000 labs received Medicare payments in 2017, 3 labs received $1.1 billion of the $7.1 billion (15 percent) in total payments for lab tests.  Spending in the top 25 tests was similarly concentrated among a few labs: 1 percent of labs received 55 percent of all Medicare payments for the top 25 lab tests in 2017., Clinical labs play a critical role in delivering health care to millions of Medicare beneficiaries.  The new payment system for lab tests took effect on January 1, 2018, and resulted in significant changes to the Medicare payment rates for lab tests.  This data brief, like those before it, will provide baseline statistics that OIG will use to measure the effects of changes to the payment system when data from 2018 become available.  We will continue to monitor Medicare payments for lab tests and to identify emerging trends in these payments and vulnerabilities to potential cost savings."

467,A-03-18-00003,Medicare Critical Care Services Provider Compliance Audit: Clinical Practices of the University of Pennsylvania A-03-18-00003 10-02-2020,"Medicare paid approximately $1.6 billion for critical care services provided to Medicare beneficiaries nationwide from October 2016 through March 2018 (audit period).  A previous OIG review of critical care services found that few problems existed and concluded that those problems could be corrected by Medicare contractors.  However, that review did not utilize medical review to determine whether the critical care services were appropriate and medically necessary.  We selected for audit Clinical Practices of the University of Pennsylvania (Clinical Practices) because it was one of the 10 highest-paid providers of critical care services during our audit period., Our objective was to determine whether Clinical Practices complied with Medicare requirements when billing for critical care services performed by its physicians., Our audit covered $5.1 million in Medicare Part B payments for 28,085 critical care services provided during our audit period.  We selected for review a random sample of 150 critical care services totaling $27,053.  Clinical Practices provided us with supporting documentation for the sampled claims.  We submitted the 150 critical care services to an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the services were medically necessary and properly coded., Clinical Practices complied with Medicare billing requirements for 136 of the 150 critical care services that we reviewed.  However, Clinical Practices did not comply with Medicare billing requirements for the remaining 14 critical care services, and these errors resulted in Clinical Practices receiving $1,399 in unallowable Medicare payments.  These errors occurred because Clinical Practices incorrectly identified and billed critical care services for physician services that did not meet Medicare requirements.  , On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Clinical Practices received overpayments of at least $151,588 for the audit period., We recommend that Clinical Practices: (1) refund to the Medicare administrative contractor $151,588 in estimated overpayments for critical care services; (2) based upon the results of this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule and identify any of those returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendation; and (3) strengthen policies and procedures to ensure that critical care services billed to Medicare are adequately documented and correctly billed., In written comments on our draft report, Clinical Practices did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our finding and recommendations.  However, it did state that it is taking corrective action to improve provider documentation to reflect the severity of illness and the treatment provided to critically ill patients and to correct inadvertent errors made by its professional fee coding staff.  In another correspondence, Clinical Practices indicated that it was planning to refund the $151,588 in estimated overpayments to the Medicare administrative contractor.  Clinical Practices did not address our recommendation to identify, report, and return overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule., We commend Clinical Practices for the actions it has taken and plans to take to address the deficiencies identified in our draft report related to its compliance with Medicare requirements when billing for critical care services.

S. Department of the Interior's (DOI) OIG and U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) OIG participate with HHS OIG in a joint CIGIE initiative to audit Federal programs that serve AI/AN communities.  As part of this effort, each participating OIG agreed to conduct audit work at the same Indian Tribe in Oklahoma, and each OIG would audit the specific program areas under its purview.  Thus, we initiated an audit of the Head Start Program. , Our objective was to determine whether Seminole Nation of Oklahoma operated its Head Start Program and managed the funds in accordance with Federal requirements. , We reviewed $222,730 of the Head Start costs that Seminole Nation claimed during the audit period, February 1, 2017, through January 31, 2018.  We also reviewed written policies and procedures and assessed Seminole Nation's management of Head Start Program operations., Seminole Nation did not always operate its Head Start Program and manage its Head Start funds in accordance with Federal requirements and did not have effective controls and accountability over funds.  Specifically, Seminole Nation did not have effective controls to restrict access to the accounting system, as some employees had access to modules not needed for their job functions and the accounting system access list included five former employees and two unidentified users.  Seminole Nation also did not have effective controls to restrict access to executive signature stamps since the Principal Chief was not maintaining his own signature stamp.  In addition, Seminole Nation did not allocate costs in proportion to the benefit received, did not provide adequate support for $5,095 in expenditures, did not submit required Federal Financial Reports, purchased equipment that did not benefit the Program until after the grant year, and did not track administrative costs., We recommend that Seminole Nation (1) implement controls and develop policies and procedures that restrict access to the accounting system and the executive signature stamps and (2) develop and implement policies and procedures regarding the purpose and use of the signature stamps.  In addition, we recommend that Seminole Nation refund $5,095 to the Federal government for the inadequately documented costs and strengthen existing controls to ensure that costs charged to the Head Start Program are properly supported with adequate documentation., The report contains additional policy and procedural recommendations for Seminole Nation to operate its Head Start Program and manage the funds in accordance with Federal requirements., In written comments on our draft report, Seminole Nation concurred with our findings and indicated it would take immediate action to remedy the deficiencies and create stronger and more reliable controls to keep the deficiencies from reoccurring., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"
469,A-04-18-04067,Inadequate Edits and Oversight Caused Medicare To Overpay More Than $267 Million for Hospital Inpatient Claims With Post-Acute-Care Transfers to Home Health Services A-04-18-04067 08-05-2020,"Prior OIG audits identified Medicare overpayments to hospitals that did not comply with Medicare's post-acute-care transfer policy (transfer policy).  CMS generally concurred with our recommendations, but subsequent analysis that we conducted indicated that CMS's system edits were still not properly designed and that hospitals may be  using condition codes to bypass CMS's system edits to receive higher reimbursements for inpatients transferred to home health services., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare properly paid acute-care hospital inpatient claims subject to the transfer policy when hospitals: (1) did not code the claims as a discharge to home with home health services when the beneficiary resumed home health services within 3 days of discharge, (2) applied condition code 43 indicating that the home health services were not provided within 3 days of discharge, or (3) applied condition code 42 indicating that the home health services were not related to the inpatient hospital services., For fiscal years 2016 and 2017, we identified 89,213 inpatient claims totaling $948 million at risk of overpayment because of the transfer policy.  We selected a stratified sample of 150 claims, and an independent medical review contractor reviewed the medical records to assess the relatedness of the home health services to the hospital admission. , Medicare improperly paid most inpatient claims subject to the transfer policy when beneficiaries resumed home health services within 3 days of discharge but the hospitals failed to code the inpatient claim as a discharge to home with home health services or when the hospitals applied condition codes 42 (home health not related to inpatient stay) or 43 (home health not within 3 days of discharge).  Of the 150 inpatient claims in our sample, Medicare properly paid 3; however, it improperly paid 147 with $722,288 in overpayments.  Medicare should have paid these inpatient claims using a graduated per diem rate rather than the full payment.  Based on our sample results, we estimated that Medicare improperly paid $267 million during a 2-year period for hospital services that should have been paid a graduated per diem payment., We recommend that CMS direct its Medicare contractors, for the claims that are within the 4-year reopening period, to: (1) recover a portion of the $722,288 in overpayments identified in our sample, (2) reprocess the remaining inpatient claims in our sample frame with an incorrect patient discharge status code or condition code 43 to recover a portion of the estimated $225.7 million in overpayments, and (3) analyze the remaining inpatient claims in our frame with condition code 42 and recover a portion of the estimated $40.6 million in potential overpayments.  Also, we recommend that CMS correct its related system edits, improve its provider education related to the Medicare transfer policy, and use data analytics to identify hospitals disproportionally using condition code 42.  Finally, we recommend that CMS consider reducing the need for clinical judgment when processing claims under the post-acute-care transfer policy by taking the necessary actions, including seeking legislative authority if necessary, to deem any home health service within 3 days of discharge to be ""related."" , CMS concurred with all but our last recommendation and described actions that it had taken or planned to take to address the recommendations.  We maintain that CMS should further explore reducing the need for clinical judgment when processing claims under the post-acute-care transfer policy and revised our recommendation to have CMS consider this change.	, Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

This review, initiated before the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, focuses on staffing data from 2018.  However, the 2020 pandemic reinforces the importance of adequate staffing for nursing homes, as inadequate staffing can make it more difficult for nursing homes to respond to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. , Consumers need meaningful information about nurse staffing at nursing homes to make informed care decisions.  CMS created the Payroll-Based Journal (PBJ)-a system containing self-reported provider data-to collect nursing homes' daily staffing hours.  CMS uses the PBJ data to calculate Staffing Star Ratings reported on the public Nursing Home Compare website.  CMS requires a minimum number of daily hours for different types of nurses (nursing homes must have a registered nurse (RN) on staff at least 8 hours each day and licensed nurses on staff around the clock).  However, CMS does not use PBJ data to enforce these daily Federal staffing requirements, nor does it regularly publish day-to-day nurse staffing on Nursing Home Compare., We analyzed nursing homes' 2018 daily staffing data from the PBJ.  We determined how frequently nursing homes reported daily staffing levels below federally required levels in 2018 and identified quarterly trends.  We compared nursing homes' quarterly Staffing Star Ratings to their daily staffing levels.  To discuss residents' experiences with daily fluctuations in nurse staffing, we electronically surveyed 20 Local Long-Term Care Ombudsmen., Of 12,862 nursing homes, 7 percent (943) reported 30 or more days in 2018 on which staffing was below at least 1 required staffing level.  Additionally, another 7 percent of nursing homes (900) reported between 16 and 29 days with staffing below required levels in 2018.  This raises concerns that some nursing homes may not have fully met their residents' needs in 2018.  CMS implemented a policy in 2018 to downgrade nursing homes' Staffing Star Ratings to 1 Star for having at least 7 total days within a quarter with no reported RN time.  Following CMS's announcement of this policy, 27 percent fewer nursing homes reported days with no RN time.  At the same time, 7 percent more nursing homes reported days with some RN time, although less than the required 8 hours per day.  These trends suggest overall improvements in staffing levels.  Finally, we found that daily staffing levels reported by individual nursing homes often did not match their Staffing Star Rating published on Nursing Home Compare.  While some nursing homes' reported staffing levels varied considerably from day to day, other nursing homes' daily staffing levels were more consistent., We recommend that CMS: (1) enhance efforts to ensure nursing homes meet daily staffing requirements and (2) explore ways to provide consumers with additional information on nursing homes' daily staffing levels and variability.  While CMS did not explicitly state concurrence with the recommendations, CMS outlined the actions it has taken and plans to take to achieve the recommendations' goals."
471,A-09-18-01005,Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Monitoring of Opioid Use: States Have Taken Action To Address the Opioid Epidemic ,"We identified actions that selected States took related to their oversight of opioid prescribing and their monitoring of opioid use.  The selected States were Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington State, and West Virginia.  This report summarizes and compares information provided by the eight States., The States have created policies and procedures and passed laws and regulations related to opioids.  The States are using opioid-related data to perform data analytics, as well as performing outreach to providers and patients.  The States have implemented a number of opioid-related prevention, detection, and treatment programs.  Finally, the States have taken many other actions to address the opioid epidemic., This report contains no recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
472,OEI-05-18-00470,Few Patients Received High Amounts of Opioids from IHS-Run Pharmacies OEI-05-18-00470 12-09-2020,"OIG has been tracking opioid use in Department of Health and Human Services programs since 2016.  Previous OIG evaluations have assessed opioid use in both Medicare and Medicaid, including identifying beneficiaries at serious risk of misuse or overdose.  This issue brief focuses on IHS, which serves an American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population that may be at increased risk of misuse or overdose.  Between 2016 and 2017, AI/ANs experienced a larger percentage increase in deaths involving prescription opioids than any other group.  In addition, previous OIG work found that some IHS hospitals did not always follow IHS policy when prescribing and dispensing opioids., We analyzed prescription drug data for opioids received from IHS-run pharmacies between May 2018 and April 2019.  We calculated patients' morphine equivalent dose-a measure that translates various opioid formulations and strengths into a standard value-to compare opioids received across patients and prescriptions.  In addition, we reviewed IHS documents regarding IHS's policies for prescribing and dispensing opioids and steps that IHS has taken in response to the opioid crisis.  We also conducted interviews with IHS officials and staff to understand (1) the results of IHS's efforts; (2) how IHS monitors opioid use and opioid-related activities; and (3) challenges that IHS faces in preventing and detecting opioid misuse. , OIG's analysis of IHS data on prescription drugs showed that few patients received high amounts of opioids from IHS-run pharmacies.  IHS has taken a number of steps to ensure appropriate opioid use among its patients, and IHS officials highlighted positive outcomes from these initiatives.  However, IHS could improve the efficiency of its opioid monitoring systems by further automating its system for electronic health records (EHRs).  Additionally, IHS officials reported challenges in using State-run prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) and in tracking patient care received outside of IHS; both factors can limit IHS staff's ability to monitor opioid use.  , We recommend that IHS (1) assess the costs and benefits of updating its EHR system with tools to support more automated monitoring and (2) request support from States and Federal partners to address challenges in using State run PDMPs.  IHS concurred with both recommendations.  "

For the related-party leases, we evaluated the less-than-arm's-length relationship and determined the amount of allowable rent expense.  For the related-party receivable, we reviewed the activity and collection efforts., Sharon Baptist did not comply with Federal requirements applicable to related-party rent and related-party receivable transactions.  Specifically, Sharon Baptist claimed rent expense to which it was not entitled under Federal regulations on one of its properties, totaling $36,264 during our audit period, as well as an additional $489,564 during the period February 1, 2003, through January 31, 2012.  Additionally, Sharon Baptist has not returned to the Federal Government $171,000 in embezzled funds., We recommend that Sharon Baptist (1) refund to the Federal Government the $36,264 in unallowable rent expense charged to its direct Head Start grant during our audit period, (2) work with ACF to determine the portion of the $489,564 in rent expense from prior periods that should be refunded and refund the appropriate amount, and (3) refund to the Federal Government the $171,000 in embezzled funds., In written comments on our draft report, Sharon Baptist concurred with our findings; however, it did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations.  Sharon Baptist stated that it never attempted to conceal its relationship with related parties and believed that funds it received were unrestricted and could be used to supplement program operations.  , After reviewing Sharon Baptist's comments, we revised our report to clarify Sharon Baptist's position on its attempts to recover embezzled funds.

474,A-09-19-03003,CMS's Controls Over Assigning Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers and Mailing New Medicare Cards Were Generally Effective but Could Be Improved in Some Areas A-09-19-03003 01-13-2020,"From the beginning of the Medicare program, beneficiaries' Medicare cards displayed Social Security numbers (SSNs), which increased beneficiaries' vulnerability to identity theft.  To meet the requirements of a 2015 Federal law, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) generated new randomized insurance numbers, called Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers (MBIs), to replace SSNs on Medicare cards; assigned the MBIs to beneficiaries; and mailed new Medicare cards.  Because deficiencies in assigning MBIs and mailing new Medicare cards could have resulted in unintended consequences, such as claim processing errors and inappropriate release of personally identifiable information, we evaluated CMS's internal controls over implementation of the new MBIs., Our objective was to assess CMS's internal controls over assigning MBIs and mailing new Medicare cards to beneficiaries., We reviewed policies, procedures, and system controls; Medicare Enrollment Database (EDB) records; Medicare card mailing data (e.g., beneficiary names, MBIs, and mailing addresses); and Medicare payments from January 2018 through March 2019.  Specifically, we identified beneficiaries with multiple MBIs, new Medicare cards mailed to deceased beneficiaries, and payments for claims with service dates after beneficiaries' dates of death., CMS's controls were generally effective in ensuring that (1) beneficiaries were properly assigned MBIs, (2) deceased beneficiaries were not mailed new Medicare cards, and (3) payments were not made on behalf of deceased beneficiaries.  However, in a small percentage of cases, CMS's controls did not prevent multiple MBIs from being assigned to beneficiaries or prevent mailing of new Medicare cards to deceased beneficiaries.  In addition, CMS made improper payments of $2.3 million on claims for deceased beneficiaries., Specifically, we found that CMS assigned to 22,662 beneficiaries 2 or more MBIs associated with multiple enrollment records that contained the same SSN and date of birth because CMS's system controls did not always identify and merge multiple enrollment records before assigning the MBIs.  (The MBIs represented 0.02 percent of the MBIs assigned to Medicare beneficiaries.)  In addition, CMS mailed 58,420 new Medicare cards after the beneficiaries' dates of death, of which 2,222 were mailed after the EDB was already updated with the dates of death because CMS's system controls did not always check the EDB's date-of-death information in a timely manner before card mailing data were sent to the print/mail contractor.  (The 58,420 Medicare cards represented 0.09 percent of the total cards mailed.)  Finally, CMS made improper payments for claims with dates of service after the beneficiaries' dates of death even though it had policies, procedures, and system controls to ensure that payments were not made for Medicare services on behalf of deceased beneficiaries.  By improving its controls, CMS can limit unintended consequences, such as claim processing errors and inappropriate release of personally identifiable information., We recommend that CMS improve its system controls by checking the EDB's date-of-death information as close as reasonably possible to the date that card mailing data are sent to the print/mail contractor to ensure that Medicare cards are not mailed to deceased beneficiaries.  We also make two more recommendations, which are shown in the report., CMS concurred with our recommendations and provided information on actions that it planned to take to address our recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
475,OEI-BL-18-00460,States' Use of Grant Funding for a Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis OEI-BL-18-00460 03-13-2020,"To address the increased need for treatment services, the 21st Century Cures Act established the State Targeted Response to the Opioid Crisis grant program (STR grant program).  Through this program, SAMHSA awarded almost $1 billion in grants to States over a 2-year grant period (May 2017 through April 2019).  States were required to use these funds to expand access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), especially medication-assisted treatment (MAT); reduce unmet treatment needs; and reduce opioid overdose-related deaths through the provision of prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. , For 56 States and territories that received STR grants, we examined how much of each State's award remained unspent at the end of the first and second years of the grant period.  We also reviewed State progress reports to determine how States used STR grant funds to expand access to OUD prevention, evidence-based treatment, and recovery support services.  We also reviewed the number of patients who received OUD treatment and recovery services., More than $300 million-almost a third of the total nationwide grant funding for the STR grant program-remained unspent after 2 years.  Among individual States, 14 spent less than half of their respective grant allocations.  In total, all but six States requested extensions-known as no cost extensions-that will allow them up to an additional 12 months to use their STR funding.  States primarily attributed spending delays to challenges related to State procurement processes.  Additionally, several States are in danger of exceeding the legislatively mandated 5-percent cap on administrative costs.  , Across all States, 65 percent of spending was devoted to improving access to treatment in general for OUD, and as a result, States reported that the number of patients receiving any type of OUD treatment increased substantially during the grant period.  However, although SAMHSA required States to use STR grant funds to implement or expand access specifically to evidence-based OUD treatment-particularly, MAT-the agency did not collect data on how many patients specifically received MAT versus other types of treatment (i.e., detoxification or abstinence-based treatment).  , Given the lack of data, it is unclear how successful the STR grant program was at achieving its goal of expanded access to MAT.  Without such data, SAMHSA has limited means to monitor whether the money spent through the STR grant program, or other future grant programs, is helping patients obtain effective, evidence-based treatment for OUD., We recommend that SAMHSA work closely with States and territories during the no-cost extension period to address barriers to timely spending and to ensure that administrative cost caps are not exceeded.  Additionally, we recommend that SAMHSA require States that receive grants for OUD treatment to specifically report how many patients are receiving MAT.  SAMHSA concurred with our recommendations."
476,A-07-19-06084,Colorado's Monitoring Did Not Ensure Child Care Provider Compliance With State Criminal Background Check Requirements at 18 of 30 Providers Reviewed,"The Child Care and Development Block Grant Act (CCDBG Act) of 2014 added new requirements for States that receive funding from the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) to conduct comprehensive criminal background checks on staff members and prospective staff members of child care providers every 5 years.  Criminal background check requirements apply to any staff member who is employed by a child care provider for compensation or whose activities involve the care or supervision of children or unsupervised access to children., Our objective was to determine whether Colorado's monitoring process ensured provider compliance with State requirements related to criminal background checks established under the CCDBG Act., Our audit covered 1,023 child care providers (child care centers and family homes) that received CCDF funding during State fiscal year 2018.  We reviewed 15 child care centers and 15 family homes (we conducted unannounced site visits at the family homes).  For both types of child care providers, we worked with Colorado to identify those individuals requiring a background check who had a completed criminal background check. , Colorado's monitoring process did not ensure provider compliance with State requirements related to criminal background checks for 18 of the 30 child care providers we reviewed.  We found that 107 of 679 individuals requiring a background check did not obtain 1 or more of the required criminal background checks.  Although Colorado reviewed required background checks during its annual inspections of child care providers, the providers did not always inform the State and properly obtain background checks when hiring individuals or when new individuals began to reside in family homes.  Furthermore, Colorado did not retain criminal background check records for child care center individuals who required background checks and instead relied on the child care centers to retain these documents.  Moreover, Colorado did not require child care providers and associated individuals to receive training on background check requirements.  By not ensuring that all individuals who supervised or had routine unsupervised contact with children had passed all criminal background checks, Colorado potentially jeopardized the safety of children at these child care providers., We recommend that Colorado: (1) conduct all required criminal background checks for the 107 individuals in our sample who did not have the required checks at the time of our audit (if still employed), (2) ensure that child care providers and associated individuals requiring a background check receive training on background check requirements, and (3) ensure that all required background checks are completed and retain these records until the background check expires., Colorado concurred with all of our recommendations and described corrective actions that it had taken or planned to take.  Specifically, Colorado said that it had conducted background checks for those individuals still employed in child care and added that noncompliant providers were cited and were required to submit compliance plans.  Colorado also stated that it was in the process of developing training for child care providers and, for our third recommendation, described ongoing efforts to develop and modernize data systems that, when completed, would allow the State to store individual background check information for all licensed child care providers., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

We found that 15 of the 264 individuals requiring a background check did not have 1 or more of the required criminal background checks by the required deadlines. , The providers did not initiate a timely background check request for these 15 individuals.  Because the State agency relies on the child care provider to initiate the background check process, it was unaware that these individuals were lacking required background checks.  As a result, the safety and well-being of children were potentially at risk. , We recommend that Louisiana (1) ensure that providers initiate and complete criminal background checks for all required individuals, including those given access to children on a contingency basis, and (2) develop a process to ensure providers initiate required background checks for all employees in a timely manner., Louisiana respectfully disagreed with our findings and did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations.  Specifically, Louisiana stated it was beyond their control to enforce compliance for individuals not identified by providers or inspections.  Louisiana also stated that while it was unable to verify compliance for all providers on the first day the background check requirements were implemented, its subsequent monitoring efforts ensures provider compliance with those requirements., After reviewing the State agency's comments, we maintain that our findings are valid but have revised our recommendations.  We recognize that providers may periodically need neighbors, temporary household members, or other individuals to care for the children on a contingency basis.  We also recognize that ensuring compliance with CCCBC requirements is a process that continues beyond the effective date.

During that month, hospital care associated with these events cost Medicare and patients an estimated $324 million in reimbursement, coinsurance, and deductible payments.  Nearly half of these events were preventable.  , OIG conducted a new study to update the national incidence rate of patient harm events among hospitalized Medicare patients in October 2018.  This work included calculating a new rate of preventable events and updating the cost of patient harm to the Medicare program., The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) leads national efforts to promote quality health care and prevent patient harm.  Several agencies share this responsibility, including AHRQ, which leads HHS's efforts to improve health care quality, and CMS, which is the Nation's largest health care payer and oversight entity., Although HHS agencies have reported progress during the past decade toward improving patient safety, protecting the health and safety of HHS beneficiaries remains one of HHS's top management and performance challenges.  An increased understanding of the prevalence and nature of patient harm will further assist efforts to reduce patient harm events and the factors contributing to these events., We reviewed medical records for a random sample of 770 Medicare patients who were discharged from acute-care hospitals during October 2018.  We conducted a two-stage medical record review to estimate a national incidence rate of adverse events and temporary harm events.  Our review included all causes of patient harm regardless of whether the harm was preventable., <strong>Stage 1:</strong> Nurses screened the records for possible patient harm events using a ""trigger tool"" method.  A ""trigger"" is a clinical clue (e.g., documentation of a fall) that may indicate harm.  From the Medicare claims data, nurses also reviewed present-on-admission indicators to identify harm that developed after the patient was admitted.  We automatically referred records to Stage 2 when patients were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, regardless of whether the nurse identified harm (these include readmissions in October and November)., <strong>Stage 2:</strong> Physicians reviewed the records flagged during Stage 1 as containing possible harm events.  Physician-reviewers identified harm events and assessed the severity of events, whether events were preventable, and factors that contributed to events., We calculated the potential cost incurred by Medicare and patients as a result of these events.  We also determined whether events were on CMS's lists of hospital-acquired conditions.  Finally, we compared the results of this report to our 2010 report and explained the limitations of this comparison., Twenty-five percent of Medicare patients experienced patient harm during their hospital stays in October 2018.  Patient harm includes adverse events and temporary harm events., Twelve percent of patients experienced adverse events, which are events that led to longer hospital stays, permanent harm, life-saving intervention, or death.  In addition to the patients who experienced adverse events, 13 percent of patients experienced temporary harm events, which required intervention but did not cause lasting harm, prolong hospital stays, or require life-sustaining measures.  Temporary harm events were sometimes serious and could have caused further harm if providers had not promptly treated patients., Given the scale and persistence of patient harm in hospitals in the decade since our last report, HHS leadership and agencies must work with urgency to reduce patient harm in hospitals.  Although HHS agencies took steps to improve patient safety in hospitals, including implementing many of our prior recommendations, substantial efforts are still needed.

492,OEI-02-17-00021,Safeguards Must Be Strengthened To Protect Medicare Hospice Beneficiaries From Harm Report  (OEI-02-17-00021) 07-03-2019,"<a href=""/newsroom/media-materials/2019/hospice/"">2019: Vulnerabilities in Hospice Care</a>, This report describes specific instances of harm to hospice beneficiaries and identifies vulnerabilities in CMS's efforts to prevent and address harm.  In past work, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) raised a number of concerns about the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  As part of a recent portfolio, OIG found that hospices did not always provide needed services to beneficiaries and sometimes provided poor quality care.  Hospice care can provide great comfort to beneficiaries, their families, and caregivers at the end of a beneficiary's life.  Medicare hospice beneficiaries have the right to be free from abuse, neglect, and other harm.  When hospices cause harm or fail to take action when harm is caused by others, beneficiaries are deprived of these basic rights.  This report is the second in a two-part series addressing hospice quality of care.  The companion report identifies risks posed to Medicare beneficiaries from hospice deficiencies., We based this report primarily on 12 cases of beneficiary harm from a review of the survey reports for a purposive sample of 50 serious deficiencies in 2016.  We reviewed the survey reports and the associated plans of correction to describe the 12 cases of harm and to gain an understanding of CMS's efforts to prevent and address beneficiary harm.  We purposively selected these 12 cases for review because of the severity of harm to the beneficiary.  These cases do not represent the majority of hospice beneficiaries or hospice providers.  They also do not reflect the prevalence of harm to hospice beneficiaries., Some instances of harm resulted from hospices providing poor care to beneficiaries and some resulted from abuse by caregivers or others and the hospice failing to take action.  These cases reveal vulnerabilities in CMS's efforts to prevent and address harm.  These vulnerabilities include insufficient reporting requirements for hospices, limited reporting requirements for surveyors, and barriers that beneficiaries and caregivers face in making complaints.  Also, these hospices did not face serious consequences for the harm described in this report.  Specifically, surveyors did not always cite immediate jeopardy in cases of significant beneficiary harm and hospices' plans of correction are not designed to address underlying issues.  In addition, CMS cannot impose penalties, other than termination, to hold hospices accountable for harming beneficiaries.  , These cases reveal vulnerabilities in beneficiary protections that CMS must address.  The findings of this report provide further support for an existing OIG recommendation that CMS should seek statutory authority to establish additional, intermediate remedies for poor hospice performance.  To effectively protect beneficiaries from harm, CMS must have enforcement tools.  In addition, we make several new recommendations to strengthen safeguards to protect Medicare hospice beneficiaries from harm.  CMS should (1) strengthen requirements for hospices to report abuse, neglect, and other harm; (2) ensure that hospices are educating their staff to recognize signs of abuse, neglect, and other harm; (3) strengthen guidance for surveyors to report crimes to local law enforcement; (4) monitor surveyors' use of immediate jeopardy; and (5) improve and make user-friendly the process for beneficiaries and caregivers to make complaints.  CMS concurred with the first four of these recommendations and partially concurred with the fifth."
493,OEI-01-18-00250,Facility-Initiated Discharges in Nursing Homes Require Further Attention OEI-01-18-00250 11-18-2021,"Nursing homes can legally discharge residents for certain reasons (known as facility-initiated discharges).  Facility-initiated discharges that do not comply with regulations (i.e., inappropriate facility-initiated discharges) can be unsafe and a traumatic experience for the resident; media reports have highlighted the rise in these discharges.  For example, the police found one resident on the streets after a nursing home discharged the resident to an unlicensed boarding house without notifying the resident's family.  In addition, State Ombudsmen have cited ""discharge/eviction"" as the top complaint from 2013 through 2019.  Given concerns about inappropriate facility-initiated discharges and the risk to vulnerable nursing home residents, efforts to reduce these discharges warrant our examination. , We surveyed State Ombudsmen in all 50 States and the District of Columbia.  We also analyzed CMS administrative data to determine the number of nursing homes that received a deficiency related to facility-initiated discharge.  We interviewed officials in ACL, CMS, and all 10 CMS Regional Offices about efforts to reduce inappropriate facility-initiated discharges.  We also interviewed five State Ombudsmen about the effect of COVID-19 on these discharges., The magnitude of facility-initiated discharges in nursing homes remains unknown.  Many challenges exist to identifying and addressing inappropriate facility-initiated discharges, including that neither ACL nor CMS collect data on the number of facility-initiated discharges, and many State Ombudsmen do not count or track the notices they receive.  Nursing homes must send facility-initiated discharge notices to State Ombudsmen, but ACL does not collect data on these.  State Ombudsmen reported facing challenges while responding to facility-initiated discharges, such as nursing homes sending facility-initiated discharge notices that lack required information.  Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated challenges.  In addition, Ombudsmen, CMS, and State agencies may differ in their perspectives on regulations and enforcement of facility-initiated discharges.  Following CMS's initiative to review and take appropriate enforcement action in cases of noncompliance with facility-initiated discharge requirements, State agencies cited many more nursing homes for not complying with notice requirements for discharges in 2018.  CMS has not yet determined the trends and outcomes of its initiative., Our findings raise concerns about weaknesses in the safeguards to protect nursing home residents from harm that may result from inappropriate facility-initiated discharges.  We recommend that CMS provide training to nursing homes, assess the effectiveness of its enforcement of inappropriate facility-initiated discharges, and implement its deferred initiatives to address inappropriate facility-initiated discharges.  CMS concurred with these recommendations.  We recommend that ACL assist State Ombudsman programs with a data-collection system for facility-initiated discharge notices and establish guidance for analysis and reporting of data from these notices.  ACL concurred with these recommendations.  Finally, we recommend that ACL and CMS coordinate to strengthen safeguards to protect nursing home residents and ensure that all State Ombudsmen, State agencies, and CMS ROs have an ongoing venue to share information about facility-initiated discharges.  ACL and CMS did not explicitly state whether they concurred with our recommendation to coordinate to strengthen safeguards to protect nursing home residents but stated that they will continue to work together as well as with other stakeholders to address concerns related to inappropriate discharges.  CMS and ACL concurred with our recommendation to have an ongoing venue to share information about facility-initiated discharges. "

Medicare payments reflect their importance: nearly one-fifth of all Medicare payments are for inpatient hospitalizations.  In fiscal year (FY) 2019-prior to the COVID-19 pandemic-Medicare spent $109.8 billion for 8.7 million inpatient hospital stays.  Trends in inpatient hospitalizations from FY 2014 through FY 2019 provide important lessons for improving the accuracy of inpatient hospital billing.  From this information, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of how hospitals bill Medicare and of vulnerabilities that Medicare should address.  The pandemic has placed unprecedented stress on the country's health care system, making it more important than ever to ensure that Medicare dollars are spent appropriately., We analyzed paid Medicare Part A claims for inpatient hospital stays from FY 2014 through FY 2019.  We identified trends in hospital billing and Medicare payments for stays at the highest severity level.  Severity levels are determined by the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG)., Hospitals are increasingly billing for inpatient stays at the highest severity level, which is the most expensive one.  The number of stays at the highest severity level increased almost 20 percent from FY 2014 through FY 2019, ultimately accounting for nearly half of all Medicare spending on inpatient hospital stays.  The number of stays billed at each of the other severity levels decreased.  At the same time, the average length of stay decreased for stays at the highest severity level, while the average length of all stays remained largely the same.  , Stays at the highest severity level are vulnerable to inappropriate billing practices, such as upcoding-the practice of billing at a level that is higher than warranted.  Specifically, nearly a third of these stays lasted a particularly short amount of time and over half of the stays billed at the highest severity level had only one diagnosis qualifying them for payment at that level.  Further, hospitals varied significantly in their billing of these stays, with some billing much differently than most. , Oversight is essential to ensuring that Medicare dollars are spent appropriately.  Inpatient hospital billing in the years leading up to the pandemic indicates that some stays at the highest severity level could be susceptible to inappropriate billing.  Accordingly, we recommend that CMS conduct targeted reviews of MS-DRGs and stays that are vulnerable to upcoding, as well as the hospitals that frequently bill them.  CMS did not concur but acknowledged that there is more work to be done to determine conclusively which changes in billing are attributable to upcoding.  We also think more work needs to be done; therefore, we continue to recommend that CMS conduct targeted reviews to identify stays involving upcoding and hospitals with patterns of upcoding."
495,OEI-05-19-00060,Twenty-Three States Reported Allowing Unenrolled Providers To Serve Medicaid Beneficiaries OEI-05-19-00060 03-30-2020,"An effective provider enrollment process plays a vital role in safeguarding Medicaid from fraudulent and abusive providers.  To strengthen Medicaid provider enrollment, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) stipulated that States must require all Medicaid providers-both those in Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) and Medicaid managed care-to enroll with their respective State Medicaid agencies.  The Cures Act mandated that the Office of Inspector General (OIG) submit a report to Congress-by March 31, 2020-that assesses the extent to which States had enrolled all providers that serve Medicaid beneficiaries.  As part of the request, OIG must also provide Congress with information about the amount of Federal financial participation (FFP) that States received for services provided by Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) with unenrolled providers. , We based this study on data from the 49 States and the District of Columbia (States) that responded to our survey.  One State (Massachusetts) did not respond.  We requested information on the extent to which States had enrolled all providers.  We conducted followup with 39 States to clarify their survey responses.  We asked States to report the Federal dollars associated with unenrolled providers.  Many States could not report FFP associated with unenrolled MCO network providers.  As a result, we used information about capitation payments (i.e., payments that States make to MCOs) from Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T MSIS).  Finally, we queried staff from CMS on their work with States to enforce the Federal provider enrollment requirements.  , We found that-contrary to Federal requirements-23 States had not enrolled all providers serving Medicaid beneficiaries in their respective Medicaid programs.  As a result, beneficiaries were exposed to potentially harmful providers that had not been screened for fraud, waste, and abuse.  These 23 States reported that they had not enrolled all providers serving beneficiaries in Medicaid managed care or that they had not enrolled all ordering, referring, or prescribing (ORP) providers serving beneficiaries in Medicaid FFS. , Of the 27 States that reported enrolling all providers, 11 States enrolled all providers according to Federal requirements and had enforcement controls.  However, 16 of the 27 States reported that they were not in compliance with the requirements to collect identifying and ownership information necessary for effectively screening Medicaid providers, or that they lacked enforcement controls to ensure ongoing State compliance with provider enrollment requirements. , We recommend that CMS (1) take steps to disallow Federal reimbursements to States for expenditures associated with unenrolled MCO network providers, including seeking necessary legislative authority; (2) work with States to ensure that unenrolled MCO network providers do not participate in Medicaid managed care and assist States in establishing ways to do so; (3) work with States to ensure that they have the controls required to prevent unenrolled ORPs from participating in Medicaid FFS; and (4) work with States to ensure that they are complying with requirements to collect identifying and ownership information on Medicaid provider enrollment forms.  CMS concurred with all of our recommendations.    "
496,OEI-05-18-00480,National Review of Opioid Prescribing in Medicaid Is Not Yet Possible Report  (OEI-05-18-00480) 08-15-2019,"Historically, national Medicaid data—a collection of data submitted by all States—have not been complete, accurate, and timely.  These data have not yet been adequate for national analysis and oversight, even though some States' data have been sufficient for individual State analysis.  Because of concerns with the quality and completeness of the national Medicaid claims database-the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS)-we assessed the completeness of variables needed to monitor national opioid prescribing in Medicaid., We assessed variables needed to identify (1) beneficiaries at risk of opioid misuse or overdose (i.e., variables needed to calculate beneficiaries' total opioid dosage, and diagnosis codes to exclude patients for whom higher doses of opioids may be appropriate) and (2) the National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) of providers that ordered and dispensed opioids (i.e., prescribers and pharmacies, respectively)., A national review of opioid prescribing in Medicaid using T MSIS is not yet possible because not all at-risk beneficiaries and providers can be identified.  Limitations of T-MSIS data impede identification of individual beneficiaries for national opioid analysis.  Further, 32 States were missing NPI, diagnosis code, or quantity.  For the 19 States that were missing pharmacy or prescriber NPI, States were most frequently missing pharmacy NPI., To ensure the identification of at-risk beneficiaries and providers who may be overprescribing, we recommend that CMS (1) work to ensure that individual beneficiaries can be uniquely identified at a national level using T-MSIS, (2) ensure the correct submission of prescriber NPIs, and (3) clarify requirements for diagnosis codes.  CMS concurred with all three recommendations."
497,OEI-09-19-00100,"Medicare Laboratory Test Expenditures Increased in 2018, Despite New Rate Reductions","Effective in 2018, the Medicare program changed the way it sets payment rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (lab tests).  CMS replaced the previous payment rates with new rates based on private payer data collected from labs.  This is the first reform in 3 decades to Medicare's payment system for lab tests.  As part of the same legislation reforming Medicare's payment system, Congress mandated that OIG monitor Medicare payments for lab tests and the implementation and effect of the new payment system for those tests., We analyzed claims data for lab tests that CMS paid for under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) in 2018.  These tests are covered under Medicare Part B and do not include tests that Medicare paid for under other payment systems, such as the payment system for critical access hospitals or the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System.  We examined Medicare Part B spending for lab tests in 2018 as compared to 2017 and identified key factors that contributed to increased spending.  We identified notable changes to test payment rates and categories and examined factors that affected Medicare spending in certain geographic areas of the lab test marketplace.  Additionally, we identified the top 25 tests based on total spending in 2018 for each lab test procedure code., Medicare spent $7.6 billion for lab tests in 2018, a $459 million increase from $7.1 billion for 2017.  Although payment rates for most tests decreased in 2018, savings that resulted from lower rates were overtaken by increased spending on other tests.  Spending on genetic tests increased from $473 million in 2017 to $969 million in 2018 because of new and expensive tests entering the CLFS, as well as an increase in the volume of existing genetic tests.  Spending on certain chemistry tests also increased by $82 million in 2018 following the end of a discount on these tests.  Finally, a one-time spending increase on some tests occurred in cases in which the national rate was higher than the local payment rates that it replaced., We recommend that CMS seek legislative authority to establish a mechanism to control costs for automated chemistry tests.  Although CMS does not currently have statutory authority to restore the discount that it had previously used to ensure efficient pricing for these tests, CMS should seek legislative change to regain such authority.   CMS neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation.  Instead, CMS stated that it would monitor utilization and spending associated with these codes and take OIG's recommendation into consideration when determining appropriate next steps."
498,OEI-03-19-00070,States Could Do More To Prevent Terminated Providers From Serving Medicaid Beneficiaries OEI-03-19-00070 03-30-2020,"The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) includes specific program integrity requirements to ensure that States do not spend Medicaid funds on items and services associated with terminated providers.  In addition, as of July 1, 2018, the Cures Act requires State contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs) to include a provision that providers who were terminated from Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP cannot participate in their Medicaid managed care networks.  The Cures Act required OIG to determine the following: (1) whether providers in CMS's termination database are terminated from Medicaid in all States, (2) the amount of Medicaid payments associated with terminated providers, (3) whether State contracts with MCOs included a required provision that prohibits providers terminated from Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP from participating in Medicaid managed care networks, and (4) the amount of Medicaid payments to MCOs that did not have the required provision in their contracts., From CMS, we requested its termination database, which contains information on terminated providers reported by States.  We requested rosters of enrolled providers from States.  We reviewed State enrollment rosters dated between January and May 2019.  We compared terminated providers listed in CMS's February 2019 termination database to the providers in States' rosters of enrolled Medicaid providers. , We also identified fee for service claims and managed care encounter records associated with terminated providers on or after July 1, 2018.  We determined whether these providers were enrolled in Medicaid.  Finally, we examined State contracts with MCOs to determine whether States included in their contracts with MCOs a provision that terminated providers are terminated from all Medicaid managed care networks., Nearly 1,000 terminated providers-or 11 percent of all terminated providers-were inappropriately enrolled in State Medicaid programs or were associated with $50.3 million in Medicaid payments after being terminated.  These providers had been terminated for reasons such as criminal convictions, licensure issues, and provider misconduct and thus potentially posed a risk to beneficiaries' safety and quality of care.  , In addition, only eight States' managed care contracts all clearly included the provision-required by the Cures Act-that prohibits terminated providers from participating in Medicaid managed care networks.  This vulnerability may allow terminated providers to serve Medicaid beneficiaries and reduce States' ability to limit these providers' participation in Medicaid managed care networks.  At the time of our review, CMS did not check for this Cures Act required provision when reviewing States' contracts with MCOs.  Overall, States paid at least $62.3 billion in capitation payments to plans under contracts that did not include the required provision., Finally, States did not always provide complete and accurate Medicaid data to CMS, which limited the breadth of our analysis of claims, encounter records, and payments associated with terminated providers.  Therefore, our findings understate the payments associated with contracts that did not contain the required Cures Act provision and may understate the payments associated with terminated providers.  , To promote States' compliance with the requirements of the Cures Act, we recommend that CMS (1) recover from States the Federal share of inappropriate fee-for-service Medicaid payments associated with terminated providers, (2) implement a method to recover from States the Federal share of inappropriate managed care capitation payments associated with terminated providers (3) follow up with States to remove terminated providers that OIG identified as inappropriately enrolled in Medicaid, (4) confirm that States do not continue to have terminated providers enrolled in their Medicaid programs, (5) safeguard Medicaid from inappropriate payments associated with terminated providers, and (6) review States' contracts with MCOs to ensure that they clearly and specifically include the required provision that prohibits terminated providers from participating in Medicaid managed care networks.  CMS concurred with all six of our recommendations."
499,A-09-19-03007,Medicare Improperly Paid Acute-Care Hospitals $54.4 Million for Inpatient Claims Subject to the Post-Acute-Care Transfer Policy (A-09-19-03007) 11-01-2019,"Prior OIG reviews identified almost $242 million in overpayments to hospitals that did not comply with Medicare's post-acute-care transfer policy (transfer policy).  These hospitals transferred patients to certain post-acute-care settings, such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), but claimed the higher reimbursements associated with discharges to home.  Because compliance with the transfer policy has been an issue over a long period, we conducted this followup review to evaluate whether Medicare properly paid acute-care hospitals' claims subject to that policy for those claims with dates of service from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2018 (audit period)., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare properly paid acute-care hospitals' inpatient claims subject to the transfer policy., Our audit covered $212 million in Medicare Part A payments for 18,647 inpatient claims subject  to the transfer policy.  We first identified specific inpatient claims for our audit period that had a patient discharge status code indicating a discharge to home or certain types of healthcare institutions.  We used the beneficiary information and service dates from those claims to identify services from post-acute-care providers that began (1) on the same date as the inpatient discharge (e.g., SNF claims) or (2) within 3 days of the inpatient discharge (i.e., home health claims)., Medicare improperly paid acute-care hospitals $54.4 million for 18,647 claims subject to the transfer policy.  These hospitals improperly billed the claims by using the incorrect patient discharge status codes.  Specifically, they coded these claims as discharges to home (16,599 claims) or to certain types of healthcare institutions (2,048 claims), such as facilities that provide custodial care, rather than as transfers to post-acute care.  Of these claims, 83 percent were followed by claims for home health services, and 17 percent were followed by claims for services in other post-acute-care settings., Medicare makes the full Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Group (MS DRG) payment to an acute-care hospital that discharges an inpatient to home or certain types of healthcare institutions.  In contrast, Medicare pays an acute-care hospital that transfers a beneficiary to post-acute care a per diem rate for each day of the beneficiary's stay in the hospital.  The total overpayment of $54.4 million represented the difference between the amount of the full MS DRG payments and the amount that would have been paid if the per diem rates had been applied., The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) officials stated that the edits appropriately detected inpatient claims subject to the transfer policy.  However, some Medicare contractors reported that they did not receive the automatic notifications of improperly billed claims or did not take action on those claims to adjust them.  If all of the contractors had received the notifications and properly taken action since calendar year 2013, Medicare could have saved $70 million., We recommend that CMS direct the Medicare contractors to (1) recover the $54.4 million in identified overpayments, (2) identify any claims for transfers to post-acute care in which incorrect patient discharge status codes were used and direct the Medicare contractors to recover any overpayments after our audit period, and (3) ensure that the Medicare contractors are receiving the postpayment edit's automatic notifications of improperly billed claims and are taking action by adjusting the original inpatient claims to initiate recovery of the overpayments., CMS concurred with all of our recommendations and provided information on actions that it planned to take to address our recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
500,OEI-BL-18-00360,CMS Should Pursue Strategies To Increase the Number of At Risk Beneficiaries Acquiring Naloxone Through Medicaid OEI-BL-18-00360 09-18-2020,"On average, 130 people in the United States die every day from an opioid overdose.  The drug naloxone plays a critical role in saving the lives of those who abuse or misuse opioids-one review of emergency data found that, when given naloxone, 94 percent of people survived their overdose.  In April 2018, the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory stating that increasing the availability and targeted distribution of naloxone is a critical component of efforts to reduce deaths from opioid related overdoses.  Similarly, Federal and State agencies have undertaken numerous efforts to increase access to naloxone for those in need.  However, it is widely acknowledged that more needs to be done.  Medicaid covers almost 40 percent of nonelderly adults with opioid use disorder, underscoring the key role that the program can play in providing access to naloxone., We used State-reported Medicaid data to determine how total utilization for naloxone changed in the program between 2014 and 2018.  Using manufacturer-reported sales data, we determined the proportion of all naloxone distributed in the United States that was paid for under Medicaid each year between 2014 and 2018.  We used data on Medicaid drug spending to examine how statutory rebates-paid by manufacturers to States-affected Medicaid payments for naloxone during this period.  , Access to naloxone for Medicaid beneficiaries has expanded significantly, with the program paying for 21 times more doses in 2018 than in 2014.  Despite this growth, Medicaid paid for only 5 percent of all naloxone distributed in the United States in 2018.  This figure is especially concerning given that (1) Medicaid covers almost 40 percent of nonelderly adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) and (2) some States with extremely high overdose mortality rates paid for relatively little naloxone under Medicaid., Because of statutory rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicaid, the program has been able to recoup a large percentage of its spending on naloxone.  For example, in 2018, Medicaid's net cost for Narcan in 2018 was less than the substantially discounted price that Narcan's manufacturer offered to public health organizations for this ""community use"" version of naloxone., CMS and State Medicaid agencies can be encouraged by their progress to date in increasing access to naloxone while also continuing to look for ways to further expand naloxone availability under Medicaid.  We recommend that CMS pursue strategies to increase the number of at-risk beneficiaries acquiring community-use versions of naloxone through Medicaid.  CMS did not explicitly concur with our recommendation but stated that it is already pursuing multiple strategies to increase the number of at-risk beneficiaries acquiring naloxone through Medicaid and will continue to do so.

501,OEI-02-19-00130,Medicare Part D Beneficiaries at Serious Risk of Opioid Misuse or Overdose: A Closer Look OEI-02-19-00130 05-04-2020,"As the Nation continues to struggle with the opioid crisis, it is vital to gain a deeper understanding of those who are at risk of misuse or overdose.  The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic makes the need to look at this population even more pressing.  The National Institutes of Health recently issued a warning that individuals with opioid use disorder could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, as it is a disease that attacks the lungs.  Respiratory disease is known to increase the mortality risk among people taking opioids., OIG has been tracking opioid use in Medicare Part D throughout the opioid crisis.  OIG identified 71,260 Part D beneficiaries at serious risk of misuse or overdose in 2017; each of these beneficiaries received extreme amounts of opioids or appeared to be doctor shopping.  This data brief provides a deeper understanding of these beneficiaries by examining their Medicare claims from 2017 and 2018 and determining the following: their opioid amounts; the extent to which they had opioid overdoses; the extent to which they received naloxone through Medicare Part D; and the extent to which they have a diagnosis of opioid use disorder and received drugs for medication-assisted treatment (MAT drugs) through Part D.  This information is critical to helping the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) target its efforts to combat the opioid crisis., Although opioids can be appropriate under certain circumstances, steps should be taken to mitigate the risk of misuse and overdose, especially when beneficiaries receive high amounts of opioids for long periods of time.  This data brief also demonstrates that opportunities exist for CMS to expand its role in ensuring that beneficiaries receive treatment for opioid use disorder.  Although CMS is taking some significant steps, we recommend that CMS educate Part D beneficiaries and providers about access to MAT drugs and naloxone.  CMS concurred with our recommendation."
502,OEI-05-19-00220,Part D Plans Generally Include Drugs Commonly Used by Dual Eligibles: 2019 Report  (OEI-05-19-00220) 06-27-2019,"This report fulfills for 2019 the annual reporting mandate from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The ACA requires OIG to conduct a study of the extent to which formularies used by Medicare Part D plans include drugs commonly used by full benefit dual eligible individuals (i.e., individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits).  These individuals generally get drug coverage through Medicare Part D.  Pursuant to the ACA, OIG must annually issue a report with recommendations as appropriate.  This is the ninth report that OIG has produced to meet this mandate. , For this report, we determined whether the 401 unique formularies used by the 4,073 Part D plans operating in 2019 cover the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles.  We also determined the extent to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools to those commonly used drugs.  To create the list of the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles, we used the 2016 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey-the most recent data available at the time of our study.  Of the top 200 drugs, 196 are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage, 2 are excluded from coverage, and 1 is a medical supply item covered by Part D.  One additional drug is eligible for Part D coverage, but we did not include it in our analysis because we could not confidently project the use of this drug to the entire dual-eligible population., Overall, we found that the rate of Part D plan formularies' inclusion of the 196 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles is high, with some variation.  On average, Part D plan formularies include 97 percent of the 196 commonly used drugs.  In addition, 72 percent of the commonly used drugs are included by all Part D plan formularies.  These results are largely unchanged from OIG's findings in our mandated annual report from 2018, as well as from the findings in our reports from 2011 through 2017., We also found that the percentage of drugs to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools decreased slightly between 2018 and 2019.  On average, formularies applied utilization management tools to 28 percent of the unique drugs we reviewed in 2019, a decrease of 1 percentage point from 2018., 
Inclusion rates for the 196 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles are largely unchanged from the inclusion rates listed in our previous reports.  Part D formularies include roughly the same high percentage of these commonly used drugs in 2019 as they did in 2018.  As mandated by the ACA, OIG will continue to monitor and produce annual reports on the extent to which Part D plan formularies cover drugs that dual eligibles commonly use.  In addition, OIG will continue to monitor Part D plan formularies' application of utilization management tools to these drugs.  OIG has no recommendations at this time."

Identifying and managing investigators' financial conflicts of interest (financial conflicts) is critical to safeguarding the integrity of NIH-funded research.  In 2008, OIG identified serious gaps in NIH's oversight of investigators' financial conflicts.  More recently, failures by some investigators to disclose substantial contributions of resources from other organizations-including foreign governments-have raised new concerns about threats to research integrity.  This report focuses on the need for robust oversight, follows up on OIG's prior work, and seeks to determine whether NIH has addressed the gaps that OIG previously identified in the oversight of investigators' financial conflicts.  It also provides-for the first time-information about the total number and types of financial conflicts that institutions are reporting to NIH.  , We collected from NIH the number and type of financial conflicts that institutions reported in fiscal year (FY) 2018.  We sent a questionnaire and conducted an interview with staff from NIH's Office of Extramural Research (OER).  We also reviewed guidance and training documents related to investigators' financial conflicts.  Finally, we interviewed staff at three NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) regarding their procedures for reviewing the financial conflicts that institutions reported., Over the last decade, NIH has strengthened its reporting requirements and developed an online system for collecting, reviewing, and storing the financial conflicts that institutions report.  Overall, 3 percent of NIH grants in FY 2018 had investigators with financial conflicts.  These grants received $1 billion in funding during FY 2018, and institutions reported a total of 2,755 financial conflicts.  Although NIH has made substantial strides in reviewing the financial conflicts that institutions report, we found inconsistencies in the depth of its oversight reviews.  Across the three ICs that we reviewed, staff differed in the level of scrutiny they applied to their review of financial conflicts.  Furthermore, NIH lacks quality assurance procedures in its review process.  Lastly, NIH cannot identify-and does not plan to identify-whether investigators' financial conflicts involve foreign interests, but is identifying foreign affiliations through a clarification of its requirements for pre-award reporting., We recommend that NIH (1) perform periodic quality assurance reviews of the financial-conflict information in its online system to ensure the adequacy of its oversight, and (2) use information regarding foreign affiliations and support that it collects during the pre-award reporting process to decide whether to revise its financial-conflict review process to address concerns regarding foreign threats.  NIH concurred with both recommendations."

No. 115-245, directed OIG to examine the efforts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to ensure the integrity of its grant application evaluation and recipient selection processes.  This audit is part of OIG's response to this directive.
Our objective was to determine whether the National Cancer Institute (NCI) had adequate policies and procedures in its pre-award process for assessing risk when awarding grant funds. , We obtained a list of all 7,218 extramural grant awards, totaling $3.7 billion, that NCI made in fiscal year 2018.  We interviewed NIH and NCI officials familiar with the grant award process.  We obtained and reviewed NCI policies and procedures covering its grant pre-award risk assessment process.  To review the grant pre-award risk assessment process for different types of recipients and awards, we selected a nonstatistical sample of 14 grant awards, totaling $79.8 million, intended to cover a mix of the types of research awards that NCI funds. , NCI generally had adequate policies and procedures in its pre-award process for identifying an applicant's risk before awarding grant funds.  However, NCI did not adequately document its review process to assess financial capability for applicants that did not receive a grant from NCI in the 3 years before the current application.  In addition, NCI did not have written policies and procedures for conducting and documenting financial capability reviews required by the HHS Grants Policy Administration Manual (GPAM) for applicants that have received funding from NCI within the past 3 years and are experiencing financial difficulty.  To complete its pre-award process for identifying risk, NCI uses an automated system that incorporates checklists used to assess risk and to document the application and review process.  NCI used its checklists to assess risk for all 14 grants that we reviewed.  NCI designated the recipients of 5 of these 14 grants higher risk applicants because they had not received a grant from NCI within the 3 years before the current grant application.  NCI requires that these higher risk applicants undergo an additional review to assess financial capability.  We were unable to determine how NCI Specialists conducted the review because the review was not adequately documented in the grant file., Documentation of applicants' financial capability was lacking because NCI did not have adequate written procedures for conducting and documenting financial capability reviews and for determining how to manage identified risks.  In addition, NCI did not provide adequate training to guide NCI Specialists in their evaluation of applicants' financial capability.  As a result, NCI may not be identifying and mitigating all risks for applicants before grant funds are awarded., We recommend that NIH direct NCI to (1) update and strengthen written procedures for conducting and documenting applicant financial capability reviews as required by the GPAM and for determining how to manage the risks identified by NCI Specialists and (2) provide training to NCI Specialists about how to adequately document their evaluation of the financial capability of applicants. 
In written comments on our draft report, NIH partially concurred with our first recommendation and concurred with our second recommendation.  NCI described its plan to strengthen its procedures and provide additional training to staff.  We agree with these corrective actions. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/nih.asp"">National Institutes of Health </a>"

However, NEI did not perform or adequately document a required financial capability review for two of the six grant awards in our sample.  The HHS Grants Policy and Administration Manual (GPAM) requires that, before making a grant award, the awarding agency conduct a financial capability review of a grant applicant that has not received an award from a Federal agency within the preceding 3 years.  As a result, not all risks for applicants may have been identified and mitigated before grant funds were awarded., We recommend that NIH direct NEI to develop written procedures for conducting and documenting the financial capability review required by the HHS GPAM and provide training to NEI Grants Management Specialists about how to adequately document their review of a grant applicant's financial statements and the organization's financial status., In written comments on our draft report, NIH concurred with our recommendations.  NIH stated that NEI's Grants Management leadership is developing Standard Operating Procedures for reviewing and documenting financial capability reviews.

This audit is part of OIG's response to this directive.  Previous OIG audits evaluated the pre-award risk assessment process at NIH's National Eye Institute and National Cancer Institute., Our objective was to determine whether the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) had adequate policies and procedures in its pre-award process for assessing risk when awarding grant funds., We obtained a list of all 557 grant awards, totaling $468.2 million, that NHGRI made in fiscal year 2019.  We interviewed NIH and NHGRI officials familiar with the grant pre-award process.  We obtained and reviewed NHGRI policies and procedures covering its grant pre-award process., To review the grant pre-award risk assessment process for different types of recipients and awards, we selected a non-statistical sample of 32 grant awards, totaling $107.9 million, intended to cover a mix of the types of research awards that NHGRI funds. , NHGRI generally had adequate policies and procedures in place for assessing risk in its grant pre-award process when awarding grant funds.  However, we determined that NHGRI had inadequate policies and procedures as they relate to assessing the risk to NHGRI grant programs presented by foreign applicants and mitigating potential risk associated with applicants demonstrating higher risk factors.  As a result, some risks associated with foreign applicants and applicants demonstrating higher risk factors may not have been identified and mitigated before grant funds were awarded.  , We recommend that NIH direct NHGRI to: (1) improve its policies and procedures to ensure Grants Specialists monitor whether required audit reports are submitted for foreign applicants; (2) clarify existing procedures to specify when Grants Specialists should take additional steps, including the imposition of specific award conditions, to mitigate risk for new grantees; and (3) update policies and procedures for Grants Specialists to require that they review available Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990s regarding grant applicants' risk factors before awarding grant funds. , In written comments on our draft report, NIH concurred with our first and third recommendations and considered our second recommendation to be closed and implemented.  With regards to the first recommendation, NIH stated that it plans to issue enhanced guidance to monitor whether required audit reports are submitted for all applicants, not limited to foreign entities.  With regards to the second recommendation, NIH stated that it takes appropriate steps to mitigate risk for new recipients and has provided guidance that specifically addresses new grantee risk reviews and appropriate consideration of specific award conditions.  We revised the second recommendation to specifically address the need to clarify when special award conditions should be imposed.  With regards to the third recommendation, NIH stated that it will review its pre-award risk assessment policies and procedures and integrate the review of available IRS Form 990s where appropriate.  NIH plans to complete this process by the summer of 2022., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/nih.asp"">National Institutes of Health </a>"

In August 2018, the NIH Director stated that the risks to the integrity of peer review were increasing.  Subsequently, Congress provided the Office of Inspector General with $5 million for oversight of NIH., Peer review is how NIH uses scientific experts to evaluate grant applications for funding.  This study assesses the extent to which select NIH institutes and centers (ICs) met NIH's basic requirements for documenting first-level peer review when evaluating applications for extramural research grants and the extent to which ICs made funding decisions not strictly limited to the scores from that review (i.e., the extent of funding of grant applications out of rank order).  NIH's peer review process is central to its upholding its values of transparency, impartiality, and fairness, among others.  Because of this, it is important to ensure that the process works as intended., We reviewed documentation for a representative sample of extramural grants funded by six ICs in fiscal year (FY) 2018.  For those grants, we assessed NIH's compliance with selected aspects of its peer review process.  We did so by reviewing summary statements, documentation of NIH's followup to resolve peer reviewer concerns, and justifications for funding grants out of rank order.  We also reviewed the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS's) grant policy and NIH policies and NIH's written responses to our questions.  , For the six ICs we reviewed, NIH met its basic requirements for documenting first-level peer review.  It also followed up with applicants, as required, to resolve concerns about protections for human subjects and animals.  However, ICs' documentation to justify funding grants out of rank order often appeared to fall short of the requirements in HHS's Grants Policy Administration Manual, and the documentation of reasoning for those funding decisions was missing in 37 out of 109 grants in our sample.  A failure to document these justifications reduces transparency and can raise questions about undue influence., Without better insight into where and why funding out of rank order is happening, the integrity of NIH's peer review process could come under question  We recommend that NIH centrally track and monitor data on funding out of rank order and update its policy and guidance to reflect the latest HHS grants policy on justifying funding out of rank order.  NIH concurred with both recommendations."
510,OEI-04-18-00451,CMS Use of Data on Nursing Home Staffing: Progress and Opportunities To Do More OEI-04-18-00451 03-09-2021,"In April 2018, CMS began updating staffing information on Nursing Home Compare, which was a public website, with a new source for staffing data.  In December 2020, CMS moved these data to a new website, called Care Compare, that contains the same staffing information for consumers that Nursing Home Compare did.  Specifically, consumers can search nursing homes based on location and compare quality of care and staffing.  The usefulness of this information to consumers depends on the extent to which it is complete and accurate., Additionally, CMS works with State survey agencies to monitor nursing home compliance with Federal requirements, including those for staffing.  , We analyzed staffing information reported by nursing homes, conducted in-depth interviews with subject-matter experts at CMS, and reviewed CMS documentation.  We also surveyed SSAs to understand how CMS works with them to monitor compliance with nursing home staffing requirements and to identify any gaps in oversight of nursing home staffing.  Our period of review was the staffing data from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019, but we also included recent CMS actions through December 2020., CMS has taken important steps to build a new source for data on nursing home staffing and to use these data to better inform consumers and improve nursing home oversight.  CMS provides the public with some of this staffing information on the Care Compare website.  There, consumers can use Staffing Star Ratings to compare nurse staffing between nursing homes.  Additionally, CMS has implemented a robust process to ensure the reliability of this nurse staffing information.   , However, CMS has opportunities to better use the staffing information that nursing homes report.  Specifically, the staffing information that CMS provides on Care Compare could be more useful to consumers if it included data on nurse staff turnover and tenure, as required by Federal law.  CMS reported that the COVID-19 pandemic delayed its progress to implement these requirements. , Additionally, CMS can take steps to increase the reliability of the non-nurse staff information (i.e., information on physical therapists) that CMS publicly reports on Care Compare.  Non-nurse staff play a critical role in providing quality care.   , Further, CMS has taken an important step to target its oversight of nurse staffing by sharing information with State survey agencies.  Specifically, to help State survey agencies target weekend inspections, CMS now informs the agencies as to which nursing homes reported lower weekend staffing.  However, CMS can take additional steps to improve the effectiveness of State survey agencies' weekend inspections and strengthen oversight of staffing in nursing homes., OIG acknowledges the impact that COVID-19 has had on nursing home oversight and on CMS's priorities to help improve the quality of care that nursing homes provide.  We note that the pandemic also reinforces the importance of having adequate staffing to respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases.  We recommend that CMS (1) provide data to consumers on nurse staff turnover and tenure, as required by Federal law; (2) ensure the accuracy of non-nurse staffing data used on Care Compare; (3) consider residents' level of need when identifying nursing homes for weekend inspections; and (4) take additional steps to strengthen oversight of nursing home staffing.  CMS concurred with all four of our recommendations."
511,OEI-01-19-00160,Vetting Peer Reviewers at NIH's Center for Scientific Review: Strengths and Limitations Report  (OEI-01-19-00160) 09-25-2019,"Congress, NIH, and Federal intelligence agencies have raised concerns about foreign threats to the integrity of U.S. medical research and intellectual property.  In August 2018, Dr. Francis Collins, Director of NIH, raised concerns that peer reviewers were, in some cases, inappropriately sharing confidential information with others.  Subsequently, in 2018 Congress provided OIG with $5 million for oversight of NIH grant programs and operations, including the effectiveness of NIH's efforts to protect intellectual property derived from NIH-supported research.  This study assesses the strengths and limitations of NIH's Center for Scientific Review (CSR)'s vetting of peer reviewer nominees before they begin reviewing applications for research grants.  These peer reviewers have a unique opportunity to access confidential information in grant applications.  Because of this access, it is important for NIH to ensure that peer reviewers do not inappropriately disclose or divert confidential information, including intellectual property., We interviewed NIH staff at CSR, the Office of Extramural Research, the Office of Management Assessment, and the Office of Federal Advisory Committee Policy.  We discussed how CSR staff vet peer reviewer nominees and how NIH policy governs that vetting.  We also reviewed NIH policy, guidance, and training materials related to vetting peer reviewers., CSR has strengths in its approach to vetting nominees' ability to be effective peer reviewers.  CSR verifies nominees' scientific expertise using multiple sources such as their publication and grant histories.  It also assesses nominees' communication skills and their ability to leverage those skills in a peer review setting.  Peer reviewer nominees are typically well known to CSR even before their nominations, having served as temporary reviewers or having been NIH grantees.  This allows CSR to evaluate the nominees on the basis of its past experiences with them.  NIH also has controls to ensure that it does not select nominees who have engaged in research misconduct or breaches of peer review.  However, CSR's vetting of peer reviewer nominees gives little attention to foreign affiliation beyond requiring a justification for reviewers who are not based in North America.  Although nearly all of CSR's peer reviewers work at institutions within the United States, they include both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals.  CSR vets all of these reviewers in the same way.  CSR generally limits the sources it uses in vetting for other concerns (e.g., legal and moral controversies) to publicly reported information, which is unlikely to reveal such things as undisclosed foreign support., NIH is taking steps to address concerns about foreign threats to research integrity, but it could do more with respect to vetting peer reviewer nominees.  We recommend that NIH update its guidance on vetting peer reviewer nominees to identify potential foreign threats to research integrity, in consultation with national security experts, as needed, and that NIH work with the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of National Security to develop a risk-based approach for identifying those peer reviewer nominees who warrant additional vetting.  NIH concurred with both recommendations."
512,OEI-05-19-00240,"NIH Has Acted To Protect Confidential Information Handled by Peer Reviewers, But It Could Do More OEI-05-19-00240 03-31-2020","Congress, NIH, and Federal intelligence agencies have raised concerns about foreign threats to the integrity of U.S. medical research and intellectual property.  This includes foreign programs that may unduly influence and capitalize on NIH-funded research.  In August 2018, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins raised concerns that peer reviewers-who review applications for NIH extramural grants and have unique access to confidential information in those applications-were, in some cases, inappropriately sharing this information with foreign entities.  Subsequently, Congress appropriated funding for OIG to conduct oversight of NIH grant programs and operations, including examining the effectiveness of NIH's efforts to protect intellectual property derived from NIH-supported research.  This study describes and assesses NIH's oversight of peer reviewers' handling of confidential information., We interviewed NIH staff at the Office of Extramural Research, the Center for Scientific Review, the Office of Management Assessment, and the Office of Federal Advisory Committee Policy about their roles in setting and implementing policy related to peer reviewers' handling of confidential information.  We also reviewed NIH policies, guidance, and training materials related to oversight of peer reviewers.  Lastly, we collected information from NIH about its investigations of peer reviewers and about any actions it has taken against reviewers who disclosed confidential information., NIH has policies and procedures to protect the confidentiality of the peer review process and takes action against reviewers who disclose information.  To prevent disclosures, NIH requires all peer reviewers to sign electronic nondisclosure certifications and trains peer reviewers to keep the information in grant applications private.  To detect potential disclosures, NIH relies primarily on peer reviewers to report suspicious activity by other reviewers, but the agency is starting to use technology to detect disclosures.  NIH has taken a range of actions against peer reviewers found to have disclosed confidential information, including terminating the reviewer's service or referring the reviewer to law enforcement for investigation., NIH actively responds to instances of suspected undue foreign influence in peer review, but the agency is in the early stages of addressing this threat systemically.  NIH learns of instances of potential undue foreign influence in peer review primarily from its national security partners and from NIH staff.  It has responded to these instances on a case-by-case basis.  NIH is developing an approach to address foreign influence concerns systemically-through general oversight-in addition to responding to specific incidents., NIH is taking steps to address concerns about foreign threats to research integrity, and has an opportunity to more directly address-in a systemic way-concerns about foreign threats to the confidentiality of the peer review process.  We recommend that NIH conduct targeted, risk-based oversight of peer reviewers using risk indicators identified from analysis of research integrity threats.  In addition, NIH should update its training materials routinely with information about confidentiality breaches and undue foreign influence, and the agency should require all peer reviewers to attend periodic trainings about these risks.  NIH should also continue consulting with national security experts about peer review risks and mitigation to inform a risk-based oversight approach.  NIH concurred with all four of our recommendations. "
513,A-02-19-02002,The National Institutes of Health Has Controls to Mitigate the Risk That Grantees Receive Duplicate Grant Funding A-02-19-02002 03-12-2020,"This audit is part of a larger body of Congressionally directed work to conduct oversight of National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant programs and operations.  OIG was directed to examine NIH's oversight of its grantees' compliance with NIH policies, including NIH efforts to ensure the integrity of its grant application and selection processes. , Our objective was to determine whether NIH's internal controls were effective in ensuring that grantees did not receive duplicate NIH grant funding., We held discussions with NIH officials and reviewed NIH's policies and procedures for identifying duplicate grant funding.  In addition, from a sampling frame of 51,168 research grants active during our October 2017 through September 2018 audit period, totaling $26.3 billion, we selected a nonstatistical sample of 116 grants totaling $33.1 million., For each sampled grant, we used text recognition software to identify similar grants.  We then reviewed the grant documentation of each similar grant to determine if grantees received duplicate NIH grant funding., NIH's internal controls were effective in ensuring that grantees did not receive duplicate funding.  Specifically, the 116 grants in our sample did not duplicate other grant activities funded by NIH during our audit period., NIH receives approximately 80,000 applications for grant funding each year.  NIH checks all applications to identify instances of duplication.  If duplication is discovered during the application phase, NIH resolves the overlap prior to awarding funds through communication with the applicant institution to ensure that the duplication is removed by adjusting the research plan, budget, or commitment of personnel, as necessary.  , After it awards grants, NIH conducts post-award monitoring using data mining technology to identify awards with potential duplication.  If similar awards are identified, subject matter experts review them to determine if there is any duplication.  If actual duplication is identified, the duplicate award will be terminated and the identified duplicate funding will be returned to NIH. , This report contains no recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/nih.asp"">National Institutes of Health </a>"
514,OEI-03-19-00260,Medicare Part B Drug Payments: Impact of Price Substitutions Based on 2017 Average Sales Prices Report  (OEI 03-19-00260) 08-14-2019,"When Congress established average sales price (ASP) as the basis for Medicare Part B drug reimbursement, it also provided a mechanism for monitoring market prices and limiting potentially excessive payment amounts.  The Social Security Act mandates that OIG compare ASPs with average manufacturer prices (AMPs).  If OIG finds that the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by a certain percentage (currently 5 percent), the Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to substitute the ASP based payment amount with a lower calculated rate.  Through regulation, CMS outlined that it would make this substitution only if the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by 5 percent in the 2 previous quarters or 3 of the previous 4 quarters., Over the last decade, OIG has produced annual reports aggregating the results of our mandated quarterly ASP to AMP comparisons.  This annual report quantifies the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries that are a direct result of CMS's price substitution policy based on 2017 ASPs.  This report also offers a recommendation for achieving additional savings., To determine the effects of the price substitution policy, we calculated the difference between ASP-based payment and AMP-based payment for each drug with a price substitution.  We then applied this difference to the Medicare utilization for each of these drugs.  To account for a 3 quarter lag between the reporting of pricing data and the application of price substitutions, we used drug utilization data for the fourth quarter of 2017 through the third quarter of 2018 to calculate the savings based on 2017 ASP data.  , Because of the potential for savings to Medicare beneficiaries and to the program, OIG recommends that CMS expand the price-substitution policy.  CMS did not concur with the recommendation, instead stating that as additional data become available and as it continues to gain experience with the price substitution policy, it will consider further changes as necessary.  OIG recognizes that CMS, in setting policy for payment substitution, needs to achieve an important balance between safeguarding access to drugs and ensuring that Medicare and its beneficiaries do not overpay for 
drugs.  To provide greater flexibility and achieve this continued balance, any future expansion of the payment-substitution policy could contain a provision that would prevent a price substitution when there are indications that the substitution amount is below provider acquisition costs. "

In 2016, there were more than 42,000 opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States-115 deaths per day.  Nearly 7,000 of these deaths occurred in five States in the Appalachian region-Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia.  All five of these States had high opioid prescribing rates and four reported opioid-related overdose death rates that far exceeded that of the Nation.  Identifying beneficiaries who are at risk of overdose or abuse is key to addressing this crisis.  This data brief provides data on opioid use in Medicare Part D in these five States in 2017, including the number of beneficiaries who were at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose., We based this data brief on an analysis of Part D prescription drug event records for opioids received in 2017.  We determined beneficiaries' morphine equivalent dose (MED), which is a measure that converts all of the various opioids and strengths into one standard value. , Thirty-six percent of Part D beneficiaries in five States in the Appalachian region received a prescription opioid in 2017; these States are Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, and West Virginia.  Almost 49,000 beneficiaries in these States received high amounts of opioids, far exceeding levels CDC says to avoid.  Nearly 6,000 beneficiaries in these States are at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose., The use of opioids described in this study may indicate that opioids in the Appalachian region are being prescribed for medically unnecessary purposes and then diverted for resale or recreational use.  It may also indicate that the beneficiary is receiving poorly coordinated care or that the beneficiary's care may need to be reassessed.  In addition, it raises questions as to whether prescribers are checking State prescription drug monitoring databases or whether these databases have current information.  
The severity of the crisis makes it imperative that the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and OIG, continue to work with its partners to address this epidemic.  OIG is committed to fighting the opioid crisis and protecting beneficiaries from prescription drug abuse and misuse.  We are working with our law enforcement partners to bring resources and expertise to these five States through the Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force.  Further, OIG supports States' efforts to implement and enforce strong prescription drug monitoring programs that require prescribers and pharmacies to check the State database before prescribing and dispensing opioids.  By working together and expanding our efforts, we can help curb the opioid crisis in the Appalachian region and in the Nation."

A prior OIG audit found that the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) made an estimated $729 million in Medicare EHR incentive payments to eligible professionals who did not comply with Federal requirements.  In addition, 17 prior OIG audits of Medicaid EHR incentive payments found that States overpaid hospitals by $66.7 million and would in the future overpay these hospitals an additional $13.3 million.  These overpayments resulted from inaccuracies in the hospitals' calculations of total incentive payments.  This audit focuses on Medicare EHR incentive payments made to acute-care hospitals from January 1, 2013, through September 30, 2017 (audit period).  Another OIG audit will focus on Medicare EHR incentive payments made to critical access hospitals., Our objective was to determine whether CMS made Medicare EHR incentive payments to acute-care hospitals in accordance with Federal requirements., Our audit covered $10.8 billion for 8,297 Medicare EHR net incentive payments made to acute-care hospitals during our audit period.  We reviewed a statistical sample of 99 net incentive payments, totaling $152.2 million, of which 53 were final and 46 were non-final payments.  , CMS did not always make Medicare EHR incentive payments to acute-care hospitals in accordance with Federal requirements.  Specifically, of 99 sampled net incentive payments, 50 net incentive payments were incorrect (totaling $1.3 million, or less than 1 percent of $152.2 million reviewed).  The incorrect net incentive payments occurred because (1) the Medicare administrative contractors did not review the supporting documentation for all hospitals to identify errors in the hospitals' cost-report numbers used to calculate the incentive payments, and (2) CMS did not include labor and delivery services in the incentive payment calculations, which resulted in hospitals receiving inflated incentive payments.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that CMS made incorrect net incentive payments of $93.6 million, or less than 1 percent of the $10.8 billion in total incentive payments for our audit period., To address the 50 incorrect net incentive payments in our sample, we recommend that CMS (1) recover from acute-care hospitals the portion of the $1.3 million in incorrect net incentive payments that are within the reopening period and (2) for the remaining portion of the $1.3 million, which is outside of the recovery period, notify the acute-care hospitals associated with the incorrect payments so that those hospitals can exercise reasonable diligence to investigate and return any identified similar incorrect payments.  To attempt recovery of the $93.6 million in estimated incorrect net incentive payments made during our audit period and to ensure that all final and non-final payments made after our audit period are correct, we also made two procedural recommendations to CMS (detailed in the report)., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions that it planned to take to address our recommendations.  Regarding our first recommendation, CMS said that it considers only final payments to be the payments of record upon which recoupment should be initiated.  CMS said that it concurs with our two procedural recommendations to the extent that they apply to non-final payments.  After reviewing CMS's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  CMS should initiate recoupment for final payments and ask the Medicare contractors to adjust the cost reports for non-final payments.  In addition, our procedural recommendations apply to both payment types; 63 percent of the total overpayments we identified were final payments., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

This is known as the ""50-percent rule.""  MIPPA requires OIG to determine the market shares of the types of diabetes test strips before each round of competitive bidding to assist CMS in ensuring that bidding suppliers meet the 50-percent rule.  Initially, compliance with the 50 percent rule was assessed using mail order claims only.  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the 50-percent rule by requiring that, for bids on or after January 1, 2019, CMS must use data from the non-mail order Medicare market as well as the mail-order one.  Since 2010, OIG has been conducting evaluations of the Medicare market shares of diabetes test strips provided via mail order.  This is the first OIG evaluation of Medicare market shares for diabetes test strips provided via non-mail order. , We determined the Medicare market shares for diabetes test strips types associated with a simple random sample of Medicare claims for the 3-month period of April 1, 2018, through June 30, 2018.  Our sample of 1,210 claims was drawn from a population of 1,598,926 claims for diabetes test strips provided via non-mail order to Medicare beneficiaries.  These 1,210 claims were submitted by a total of 1,192 suppliers of non-mail order diabetic test strips.  Of the 1,192 suppliers associated with our sampled claims, 1,143 responded, a 96 percent response rate by suppliers., From April through June 2018, sampled suppliers provided 34 types of diabetes test strips via the Medicare National Mail-Order Program.  The top 3 strip types accounted for 53 percent of the Medicare mail-order market, and the top 10 strip types accounted for 93 percent of the market."

(SMP) projects, which receive grants from ACL to recruit and train retired professionals and other older adults and community members to recognize and report instances or patterns of health care fraud.  OIG has collected these performance data since 1997., We based our review on data reported by 61 SMP projects for 7 performance measures pertaining to recoveries, savings, and cost avoidance and 5 performance measures relating to SMP activities.  For the first group of measures, we reviewed supporting documentation for the data.  For the second group, we reviewed the data for any discrepancies (e.g., if a project reported holding no events but reported a number of people that attended events)., In 2018, the 61 SMP projects had a total of 6,935 total active team members who conducted a total of 26,932 group outreach and education events, reaching an estimated 1.7 million people.  In addition, the projects had 278,761 individual interactions with, or on behalf of, a Medicare beneficiary., For 2018, the SMP projects reported $15,136 in expected Medicare recoveries and $5,734 in expected Medicaid recoveries.  Cost avoidance totaled $602,063, while savings to beneficiaries and others totaled $27,689.  Further, additional Medicare expected recoveries totaled $11.9 million.  These recoveries came from three projects that validated information for existing cases regarding two home health fraud schemes and one individual physician who provided unnecessary services and falsified records., In comparison to 2017, the projects reported a 23-percent increase in the number of individual interactions in 2018 (278,761, up from 226,261).  Although the number of group outreach and education events remained fairly constant between the 2 years, the projects experienced a decrease in the number of people reached through these channels (1.7 million, down from 1.9 million).  In addition, the projects reported significantly higher amounts for cost avoidance ($602,063, up from $211,749), while expected Medicare recoveries dropped ($15,136, down from $2 million). , We note that the projects may not be receiving full credit for recoveries, savings, and cost avoidance attributable to their work.  It is not always possible to track referrals to Medicare contractors or law enforcement from beneficiaries who have learned to detect fraud, waste, and abuse from the projects.  In addition, the projects are unable to track the potentially substantial savings derived from a sentinel effect, whereby Medicare beneficiaries' scrutiny of their bills reduces fraud and errors."
532,A-02-19-01016,New York Improved Its Monitoring of Its Personal Care Services Program But Still Made Improper Medicaid Payments of More Than $54 Million A-02-19-01016 12-09-2020,"Prior OIG audits found that New York did not effectively monitor its Medicaid personal care services program and, as a result, made more than $375 million in Federal Medicaid payments for services that did not comply with Federal and State requirements.  This audit was conducted to determine whether New York made improvements to its monitoring of the program and whether any of those improvements were effective., Our objective was to determine whether New York claimed Medicaid reimbursement for personal care services that complied with Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered 5,675,965 claims with Federal Medicaid payments totaling $438 million for personal care services provided during calendar years 2015 through 2018 (audit period).  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 140 claims and determined whether the services complied with Federal and State requirements., New York claimed Federal reimbursement for personal care services that did not comply with certain Federal and State requirements for 28 of the 100 sampled claims.  Specifically, New York received reimbursement for personal care services for which there was (1) no valid nursing or social assessment, (2) no independent medical review, (3) no valid physician's order or the order was not timely, (4) no documentation of services provided, and (5) no plan of care.  Additionally, for some claims, the personal care aide who provided the associated services had not undergone a timely criminal history check or did not meet training requirements., The unallowable claims occurred because New York's monitoring of the personal care services program was not adequate to ensure that services complied with Federal and State requirements.  However, we noted that in 2017, New York made some improvements to its monitoring of the program., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York improperly claimed at least $54.5 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for personal care services during our audit period.  In addition, the health and safety of some Medicaid beneficiaries may have been put at risk because their personal care aides had not undergone a criminal history check prior to providing personal care services or did not meet training requirements., We recommend that New York refund $54.5 million to the Federal Government, continue to improve its monitoring of local districts, and reinforce with local districts and personal care services providers Medicaid requirements related to personal care services., In written comments on our draft report, New York did not specifically indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations; however, it described steps that it plans to take to address them, including pursuing recovery of any payments determined to be inappropriate, reviewing each local district at least once every 2 years, reinforcing and ensuring providers comply with criminal history check and training requirements and implementing an electronic visit verification system.  We commend New York for its planned steps to improve its monitoring of the personal care services program and to ensure local districts and personal care services providers comply with Medicaid requirements related to personal care services.  We are also available to discuss our methodology with New York should it be necessary., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
533,A-07-19-05117,Medicare Made Millions of Dollars in Overpayments for End-Stage Renal Disease Monthly Capitation Payments,"Recovery Audit Contractors (RACs) assist the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) by performing audits of monthly capitation payments (MCPs) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving four or more visits per month; these audits have identified claims with improper payments.  An MCP is a monthly payment made to physicians for dialysis-related physician services provided to Medicare ESRD patients.  Only one physician may receive an MCP for all ESRD-related services provided to a Medicare beneficiary during a calendar month.  The RAC audits found that this was not always the case: some of these audits identified claims that were improperly paid, because they reflected more than one MCP for ESRD-related services provided to the same beneficiary for the same calendar month., Our objective was to determine whether CMS made Medicare MCPs to physicians for monthly ESRD-related services provided in calendar years (CYs) 2016 through 2018 in accordance with Federal requirements., Our audit covered $12.2 million in Medicare MCPs to physicians for 53,608 claims for monthly ESRD-related services with dates of service in CY 2016, CY 2017, or CY 2018 that we identified as at risk for noncompliance with Federal requirements., CMS did not always make Medicare MCPs to physicians for monthly ESRD-related services provided in CYs 2016 through 2018 in accordance with Federal requirements.  Specifically, 23,695 claims were for services for which physicians reported monthly ESRD-related billing codes more than once for the same beneficiary for the same month.  These claims consisted of 21,763 claims that resulted in $4 million in overpayments for instances in which different physicians reported codes for services and 1,932 claims that resulted in $291,813 in overpayments for instances in which the same physician reported codes for services.  Beneficiaries were responsible for up to $1.1 million in cost sharing related to these 23,695 claims.  We are setting aside potential overpayments related to an additional 1,598 claims totaling $289,169 and $74,563 in beneficiary cost sharing for CMS's review and determination.  CMS did not have adequate claims processing controls in place, to include system edits, to identify and prevent these overpayments., We recommend that CMS direct the Medicare contractors to: (1) recover the $4 million for claims that are within the reopening period; (2) recover the $291,813 for claims that are within the reopening period; (3) instruct the physicians to refund the $1.1 million in beneficiary cost-sharing amounts; (4) review the 1,598 claims for potentially duplicate claims, determine which should have been denied, and take followup actions; (5) based on the results of this audit, notify physicians so that they can exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule and identify any returned overpayments as according with this recommendation; and (6) implement improved claims processing controls, including improved system edits, to prevent and detect overpayments., CMS did not concur with our first recommendation (because, it said, some physicians may not be liable for overpayments because they could be found to be without fault under the provisions of the Social Security Act) but concurred with all of our other recommendations and described actions taken or planned.  We revised our first recommendation for this final report by deleting the reference to physicians that had been in the draft report's first recommendation.  This revision conforms to CMS provisions that the Medicare contractors make determinations regarding the recovery of overpayments.  The actions that CMS described, when fully executed, should resolve the other recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
534,A-02-19-02006,New York Provided Projects for Assistance in Transition From Homelessness Grant Services to Ineligible Individuals and Did Not Contribute Any Required Non-Federal Funds A-02-19-02006 12-04-2020,"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) awarded States $62 million in grant funds for their Projects for Assistance in Transition From Homelessness (PATH) programs during the period September 2016 through August 2017 (grant period).   PATH programs are funded to support outreach and other services to homeless individuals with serious mental illnesses (consumers).  New York was awarded $4.2 million in PATH grant funds, one of the largest grants awarded for the grant period.  This is the first in a series of audits by OIG to ensure the integrity and proper stewardship of PATH grant funds aiming to reduce homelessness. , Our objective was to determine whether New York complied with PATH program requirements. , Our audit covered $4.2 million in PATH grant funds that New York received during the grant period.  We selected a random sample of 50 consumers out of a sampling frame of 4,126 consumers and determined whether they were eligible for the PATH program.  We also audited PATH program costs for all 20 providers funded under New York's PATH program., New York did not always comply with PATH program requirements.  Specifically, 7 of the 50 consumers we sampled lived in permanent housing settings and documentation in their case files did not indicate that they continued to need PATH services to prevent a recurrence of homelessness.  In addition, New York did not meet its funding obligation for non-Federal contributions to its PATH program and did not have written agreements with PATH providers, as required.  Also, New York inaccurately reported the number of consumers enrolled in its PATH program and did not timely file its financial report to SAMHSA.  Finally, New York has not performed the financial closeout of its PATH program and did not verify that funds were appropriately used by providers or that unused funds were returned to the Federal Government., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that 578 consumers (14 percent) were ineligible to receive PATH program services.  Also, New York did not meet its funding obligation for non-Federal contributions, which resulted in the entire grant amount of $4.2 million being unallowable., We recommend that New York refund the entire grant amount, totaling $4.2 million, to the Federal Government.  We also made two procedural recommendations, including that New York ensure that PATH program services are only provided to eligible consumers. , In written comments on our draft report, New York disagreed with our monetary recommendation but agreed with our procedural recommendations and described steps it plans to take to implement them.  New York also stated that six of the seven consumers we determined to be living in permanent housing settings were correctly determined eligible at the time they were admitted to the PATH program., We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  SAMHSA indicated that it does not consider the non-Federal contributions requirement met if these funds were not used towards the PATH program.  Also, we did not assess OMH's initial eligibility determinations for the six consumers.  Rather, we determined if the consumers maintained eligibility for our grant period. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/samhsa.asp"">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>"

PATH programs are funded to support outreach and other services to homeless individuals with serious mental illnesses (consumers).  Texas was awarded approximately $10 million in PATH grant funds and was among the largest grant funds awarded during our audit period.  This audit is part of a series of audits by OIG to ensure the integrity and proper stewardship of PATH grant funds aiming to reduce homelessness., Our objective was to determine whether Texas complied with PATH program requirements., Our audit covered $8.7 million in PATH grant funds that Texas withdrew of the $10 million it was awarded during our audit period.  We selected a random sample of 70 consumers out of a sampling frame of 10,005 consumers and determined whether they were eligible for the PATH program.  We also judgmentally selected and reviewed certain program costs for all 16 providers funded by Texas' PATH program., Texas complied with PATH program requirements related to certain program costs and non-Federal contributions.  However, it did not always comply with PATH program requirements when determining consumers' eligibility and reporting the number of consumers enrolled in its PATH program.  For 7 of the 70 sampled consumers, case files maintained by PATH providers did not support that the consumers were eligible to enroll in the PATH program.  Specifically, PATH providers did not maintain documentation in their case files that indicated the consumers met PATH eligibility requirements for being seriously mentally ill (4 consumers) or inappropriately enrolled consumers due to clerical errors (3 consumers).  In addition, Texas overstated the number of consumers enrolled in its PATH program in its Annual PATH Reports., These deficiencies occurred because Texas lacked adequate oversight to ensure that PATH providers maintained sufficient documentation to support that consumers met eligibility requirements to enroll in the PATH program.  In addition, Texas did not ensure that PATH providers reported accurate enrollment data for the State agency's annual PATH reports to SAMHSA.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that 1,001 consumers (10 percent) enrolled in Texas' PATH program were ineligible to enroll in the Texas' PATH program., We recommend that Texas (1) expand the scope of its site visits of PATH providers to include reviews of consumers' case files maintained by PATH providers to strengthen its current risk assessment process and ensure that providers only enroll eligible individuals into the PATH program and (2) work with relevant parties to provide guidance and training to PATH providers to ensure that its Annual PATH Report accurately represents the number of consumers served by its PATH program., In written comments on our draft report, Texas did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our findings or recommendations; however, it described steps that it has taken or plans to take to address the deficiencies identified in our draft report related to its compliance with PATH program requirements., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/samhsa.asp"">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>"

Additionally, in a recent series of audits of State-monitored child care facilities in various States, we found that the majority of child care providers had instances of potentially hazardous conditions and noncompliance with State health and safety requirements, including employee background record check requirements.  To determine whether similar vulnerabilities exist in foster care group homes, we performed this audit in Kansas.  Allegations of neglect and abuse at some foster care group homes in Kansas were the subject of a number of reports in the media, both before and during our audit., Our objective was to determine whether Kansas ensured that foster care group homes complied with State licensing requirements related to the health and safety of children in those group homes in accordance with Federal laws and regulations., We conducted site visits at all of the 31 foster care group homes that were licensed to house between 5 and 24 foster care children to determine whether the group homes complied with State licensing requirements related to health and safety.  We reviewed background record check completion dates for each group home employee who could engage in unsupervised contact with children in foster care., Kansas did not ensure that all foster care group homes complied with State licensing requirements related to the health and safety of children in those group homes in accordance with Federal laws and regulations.  Specifically, at the times of our site visits we found that 24 of the 31 group homes did not comply with State environmental requirements; this is because Kansas did not address all instances of noncompliance with environmental standards during annual inspections.  In addition, 29 of the 31 group homes did not comply or could not document compliance with the required background record check or fingerprint submission requirements for employees.  These instances occurred because Kansas did not ensure that the required background checks for all employees were requested in a timely manner.  Furthermore, 1 of the 31 group homes did not comply with the terms of its State licensing requirements because it housed both male and female children but was licensed to house only female children.  Nevertheless, Kansas allowed this foster care group home to continue operations and did not require that the home submit a request for an amended license allowing the home to also house males., We recommend that Kansas: (1) follow up with all foster care group homes to verify that all of the maintenance deficiencies that we identified are corrected, (2) improve controls to ensure that group homes are in compliance with State licensing requirements related to the health and safety of the residents, and (3) ensure that corrective action is taken when issues of noncompliance are found.  We also make procedural recommendations to Kansas regarding the controls over and timely completion of background record checks and the monitoring of the group homes to ensure that they are in compliance with the age and gender requirements of their State licensing agreements., Kansas concurred with all of our recommendations and with our finding on the foster care group home that housed both male and female children; this group home lost its license and was closed.  Kansas also described corrective actions taken or planned.  Kansas disagreed with our other findings and provided additional documentation regarding some of them.  After reviewing that material, we revised the number of errors we identified.  We acknowledge Kansas's oversight efforts and corrective actions but continue to hold that our findings as revised-and all of our recommendations-are valid., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

For State fiscal years (SFYs) 2009-14, Tennessee claimed a total of $2 billion in CPEs., For SFYs 2010-13, Tennessee each year claimed the same amount of $373.8 million, indicating that it may not have calculated specific estimates of the CPEs for each of those years, as required.  Additionally, a recent audit found that another State had improperly paid $686 million in Medicaid supplemental pool payments. , Our objective was to determine whether Tennessee complied with Federal requirements for claiming CPEs for public hospital unreimbursed costs., Our audit covered the $2 billion in CPEs that Tennessee claimed for SFYs 2009-14 (audit period), which were the most recent SFYs for which supporting calculations of actual CPEs were available.  We compared the CPEs that Tennessee claimed to its summaries of actual CPEs for each SFY and reviewed the UCC calculations and supporting documentation for five hospitals that received disproportionate share hospital payments and five institutions for mental diseases (IMDs)., Tennessee did not comply with Federal requirements for claiming CPEs for public hospital unreimbursed costs.  Of the $2 billion in CPEs that Tennessee claimed during our audit period, $909.4 million was allowable and supported.  However, the remaining $1.1 billion ($767.5 million Federal share) exceeded the amount allowed.  This amount included $482.1 million ($337.5 million Federal share) of excess CPEs that Tennessee claimed but did not return after calculating actual CPEs.  , In addition, the actual CPEs that Tennessee calculated included another $609.4 million ($430 million Federal share) that exceeded the allowable amount.  It was composed of $522.3 million ($370.1 million Federal share) of unsupported net costs of caring for IMD uninsured patients, $53.6 million ($37.9 million Federal share) of unallowable net costs of caring for TennCare IMD patients between the ages of 21 and 64, and $33.5 million ($22 million Federal share) of overstated costs because of incorrect calculations., We recommend that Tennessee: (1) refund $397.4 million in overpayments to the Federal Government for CPEs that it claimed in excess of the allowable amount; (2) provide support for or refund to the Federal Government $370.1 million for the net costs of caring for uninsured IMD patients for which it did not provide detailed supporting documentation; and (3) establish additional policies and procedures to ensure compliance with Federal requirements.  The detailed recommendations are listed in the body of the report., In written comments on our draft report, Tennessee disagreed with our first recommendation, objecting to the years covered by our audit and to our interpretation of Federal requirements governing costs related to IMD patients between the ages of 21 and 64.  Tennessee disagreed with our second recommendation, stating that, in addition to its disagreement regarding Federal requirements, it provided sufficient data to support uninsured IMD costs.  Tennessee generally agreed with our third recommendation to establish additional policies and procedures except that it did not agree that it should establish policies to identify and exclude costs for IMD patients between the ages of 21 and 64.  After considering Tennessee's comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid for the reasons detailed in the report.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
539,OEI-06-19-00330,Indian Health Service Has Strengthened Patient Protection Policies but Must Fully Integrate Them Into Practice and Organizational Culture OEI-06-19-00330 12-18-2019,"In recent years, IHS has had a number of cases of healthcare providers abusing patients under facility care, including a pediatrician who was convicted of multiple counts of child sexual abuse.  In February 2019, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services requested that OIG assess IHS policies and procedures for preventing, reporting, and addressing patient abuse.  In the same month, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs also requested that OIG review applicable IHS policies, procedures, standards, and other requirements intended to prevent and address misconduct.  This study identified strengths and gaps in IHS policies, and challenges to their early implementation., We based our findings on document reviews and interviews with 45 officials and staff at IHS headquarters (HQ) and Area Offices, conducted in July-August 2019.  We also reviewed IHS policies and other relevant documents and compared them to similar policies from three benchmark organizations: the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, and the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.  Topics for our interviews with IHS officials and staff included implementation of IHS patient protection policies and procedures, strategies for and challenges to implementation, and other IHS improvement efforts related to preventing and addressing patient abuse in IHS facilities.  , OIG found that IHS policies to prevent and address child sexual abuse included similar elements of policies developed by benchmark organizations.  IHS included provisions for provider-patient boundaries, medical examination precautions, reporting responsibilities, and protections for patients and staff.  In a few cases, IHS policies were stricter and more detailed than those of other organizations.  However, IHS policies do not explicitly address other types of abuse, adult victims, or perpetrators who are not healthcare providers.  Further, some IHS-operated healthcare facilities are early in implementation and have not updated their individual facility policies, largely due to staffing shortages and turnover of facility leadership.  IHS has trained staff on its updated policies and provided outreach to Tribal communities, but faces challenges that may discourage reporting of abuse, including difficulty ensuring anonymity, fear of retaliation, and communication barriers (e.g., language, stigma), among others.  In addition, we found significant shortcomings in IHS systems for storing and tracking patient abuse reports and confusion about roles and responsibilities related to such tasks.  IHS has initiated efforts to strengthen systems and oversight., To address these issues and further protect patients from abuse, we recommended that IHS: (1) extend policies to address more types of perpetrators, victims, and abuse; (2) ensure that the new incident reporting system is effective and addresses the risks identified in the current system; (3) designate a central owner in IHS HQ to ensure clear roles and responsibilities for shared ownership in implementing patient protection policies, and managing and responding to abuse reports; (4) continue to actively promote an organizational culture of transparency, and work to resolve barriers to staff reporting of abuse; and (5) conduct additional outreach to Tribal communities to inform them of patient rights, solicit community concerns, and address barriers to reporting of patient abuse.  IHS concurred with our recommendations."
540,OEI-02-19-00180,Data on Medicaid Managed Care Payments to Providers Are Incomplete and Inaccurate OEI-02-19-00180 03-26-2021,"Effective oversight of Medicaid requires a national system with complete and accurate data.  The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid (CMS) established the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) for this purpose.  Payment data are a critical component of T-MSIS.  These data include the amounts paid, billed, and allowed for every service provided to Medicaid enrollees, including those services provided through managed care., Managed care has become the primary delivery system for Medicaid.  Each managed care plan provides the State with data about what the plan paid providers for their encounters with Medicaid enrollees.  The State is then required to submit these data to T-MSIS.  The Office of Inspector General (OIG) and others have consistently identified deficiencies in the quality of    T-MSIS data, including particular concerns with the quality of data for managed care. , CMS and others rely on T-MSIS data to provide oversight; to identify trends; and to detect fraud, waste, and abuse.  States also use payment data to set the capitation rates paid to managed care plans for each enrollee and to monitor the services provided by the plans., We analyzed the payment data from the encounter claims in T-MSIS for January 2020 for the largest managed care plan in each of the 39 States that provide comprehensive, risk-based managed care., Most States did not provide complete or accurate payment data in T-MSIS on managed care payments to providers; two States failed to provide any data for January 2020.  Notably, about half of States did not provide complete or accurate information about the amounts that managed care plans pay to providers for services-the amount paid.  Almost three-quarters of the States provided incomplete or inaccurate information about the maximum amounts that managed care plans allow for services-the amount allowed.  Over a quarter of the States provided incomplete or inaccurate information about the amounts that providers bill managed care plans for services-the amount billed. , With the rise in Medicaid enrollment and changes in utilization, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how essential it is to have complete and accurate national Medicaid data.  T-MSIS data are more important than ever to ensure proper oversight and that Medicaid funds are spent appropriately.  These data can be used to identify emerging trends as well as to inform public health efforts.  , We recommend that CMS review States' managed care payment data in T-MSIS and ensure that States have corrective action plans to improve data completeness and quality, as appropriate.  Further, CMS should make public its reviews of States' managed care data.  Finally, CMS should clarify and expand its initiative on payment data.  CMS did not concur with any of our three recommendations.  CMS noted that it has already set priority areas for improving the reporting of T-MSIS data and it will continue to assess how to further expand data quality improvement efforts.  We continue to press CMS to take the recommended actions to improve the managed care payment data in T-MSIS so that these data can be used to effectively monitor and oversee the Medicaid program.  "
541,A-02-19-02001,"In Selected States, 67 of 100 Health Centers Did Not Use Their HRSA Access Increases in Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services Grant Funding in Accordance With Federal Requirements A-02-19-02001 11-13-2020","In 2017, HHS declared the opioid epidemic in the United States a public health emergency.  As part of its efforts to combat the opioid crisis, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awarded $200.5 million in Access Increases in Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (AIMS) grants to health centers nationwide.  OIG audited AIMS grant funds awarded to health centers as part of our oversight of the integrity and proper stewardship of Federal funds used to combat the opioid crisis., Our objective was to determine whether health centers in selected States used their AIMS grant funding in accordance with Federal requirements and grant terms., Our audit covered AIMS grant funds totaling $112.9 million awarded to 665 health centers in the 30 States with the highest opioid overdose death rates in calendar year (CY) 2016. Depending on a health center's budget period, these funds could be spent during the period , September 1, 2017, through May 31, 2019.  We reviewed a statistical sample of 100 health centers from the 30 States to determine whether the health centers: (1) met AIMS grant requirements for mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) service expansion and (2) claimed allowable costs., Most health centers in the 30 States did not use their AIMS grant funding in accordance with Federal requirements and grant terms.  Sixty-seven of the 100 health centers in our sample did not meet mental health and SUD service expansion requirements (30), claimed unallowable costs (34), and did not properly allocate salaries and other expenditures to their AIMS grants (34).  These deficiencies occurred because health centers faced issues with hiring qualified staff, and their financial management systems did not ensure that only allowable, allocable, and documented costs were charged to their AIMS grants.  In addition, HRSA did not effectively monitor health centers' progress toward meeting service expansion requirements and did not ensure that health centers spent their AIMS grant funds in accordance with grant requirements., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that 454 of 665 health centers did not use their AIMS grant funding in accordance with Federal requirements and grant terms.  We also estimated that 125 health centers did not increase the total number of mental health and SUD services patients from CY 2017 to CY 2018, and that 99 health centers did not hire new staff or increase hours of existing staff within 120 days of their AIMS grant award.  As a result, patients may not have received the needed mental health or SUD services.  In addition, we estimated that the health centers charged unallowable costs totaling nearly $6 million and improperly allocated costs totaling $10.9 million to their AIMS grants that could have been spent on AIMS-related purposes.  , We made a series of recommendations to HRSA, including that it improve its monitoring of how health centers meet targets for future grant funding opportunities and charge expenditures to their HRSA grants.  We also recommend that HRSA require the health centers to refund unallowable and improperly allocated costs to the Federal Government., HRSA concurred with our recommendation that it improve its monitoring, partially concurred with our other recommendations, and described actions that it has taken or plans to take to address them.  We maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/hrsa.asp"">Health Resources and Services Administration</a>"
542,OEI-03-19-00200,Some Manufacturers Reported Inaccurate Drug Product Data to CMS OEI-03-19-00200 09-11-2020,"CMS uses average sales price (ASP) and average manufacturer price (AMP) product data to determine overall reimbursement in both Medicare and Medicaid.  Medicare Part B and Medicaid expenditures for prescription drugs total nearly $100 billion each year.  (Drugs covered by Part B are generally those that are injected or infused in physicians' offices or hospital outpatient settings.)  In Medicare Part B, CMS uses ASP to directly calculate drug reimbursement amounts paid to providers.  When these data are not accurate, Medicare and its beneficiaries may make inaccurate payments for drugs.  In addition, legislation requires OIG to conduct a comparison of quarterly ASP and AMP product data-the results of this comparative analysis can trigger reductions in Part B reimbursement for certain drugs.  If the ASP and AMP data-which include the prices and product data such as package size and package quantity-are incorrect, this can lead to inaccurate comparisons or the exclusion of certain drugs from the comparative analysis, which can, in turn, potentially lead to fewer price substitutions and higher costs.  , OIG conducted a targeted review of the accuracy of ASP product data and AMP product data for 1,345 National Drug Codes (NDCs) associated with drugs covered by Medicare Part B for 2018.  To assess the accuracy of ASP and AMP product data, we compared the following: (1) the package size and package quantity that manufacturers reported as part of the ASP product data against the drugs' labels, drug package inserts, and drug manufacturers' websites (hereinafter referred to as ""publicly available sources""); (2) the unit type and units per package size that manufacturers reported as part of the AMP product data against the information listed in publicly available sources; and (3) the package size that manufacturers reported as part of the ASP product data against the unit type reported with the AMP product data., Manufacturers reported inaccurate drug product data for 14 percent of reviewed NDCs associated with Part B-covered drugs.  Most of these errors were associated with only AMP product data, e.g., the unit type and/or units per package size reported with AMP data did not correspond to the package size and/or package quantity from publicly available sources.  Twenty-four percent of manufacturers-43 of 182- were associated with inaccurate drug product data., To ensure the accuracy of manufacturer-reported data, Part B reimbursement amounts, and Medicaid rebate amounts, CMS should work with manufacturers associated with errors to correct and resubmit accurate product data.  Although CMS did not explicitly state whether it concurred or nonconcurred with the recommendation, it outlined actions it has taken and actions that it plans to take to achieve the recommendation's goal of ensuring that manufacturers submit accurate product data.  OIG appreciates the efforts that CMS has taken to work with manufacturers to ensure that pricing and rebate data are accurate.  We agree with CMS that inaccurate ASP and AMP product data may not always result in incorrect Part B payment amounts or rebate amounts.  However, the results of CMS's review indicate that in some instances these product data inaccuracies did result in incorrect payment amounts being established by CMS.  OIG encourages CMS to continue its efforts to ensure that all manufacturer-reported product data are accurate.  We ask that CMS specify in its Final Management Decision whether it concurs with our recommendation and how it plans to continue its efforts to address inconsistencies in the AMP data."

In 2017 alone, there were 47,600 opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States.  It continues to be a public health emergency.  OIG has been tracking opioid use in Medicare during this crisis, particularly since 2016.  OIG has identified beneficiaries at serious risk of misuse or overdose and has identified prescribers with questionable prescribing for these beneficiaries.  These types of analyses are crucial to understanding and addressing the national opioid crisis.  Building on past OIG work, this data brief details opioid use in Medicare Part D in 2018 and trends in drugs used to treat opioid use disorder., We based this data brief on an analysis of Part D prescription drug event records for opioids received in 2018.  We determined beneficiaries' morphine equivalent dose, which is a measure that converts all of the various opioids and strengths into one standard value., Progress has been made in decreasing opioid use in Part D, increasing the use of drugs for medication-assisted treatment, and increasing the availability of naloxone.  It is imperative for the Department of Health and Human Services-including CMS and OIG-to continue to implement effective strategies and develop new ones to address this epidemic.  "

Our analysis showed that in 2018, an ophthalmology clinic in California (the Clinic) frequently billed for other services as being unrelated to, distinct from, or significant and separately identifiable from intravitreal (inside the eye) injections of the drugs Eylea and Lucentis. , Our objective was to determine whether the Clinic complied with Medicare requirements when billing for intravitreal injections of Eylea and Lucentis and for other services provided on the same day as the injections. , Our audit covered Medicare Part B payments of $4.3 million for intravitreal injections of Eylea and Lucentis (and for other services provided on the same day as the injections) that the Clinic provided in 2018.  We reviewed a stratified random sample of 100 beneficiary days, consisting of 627 services and drugs.  (A beneficiary day consisted of all services and drugs provided on a date of service to a beneficiary in which intravitreal injections of Eylea or Lucentis were administered.)  For each sampled beneficiary day, we provided copies of the medical records to an independent medical review contractor to determine whether the services and drugs were properly billed., The Clinic generally complied with Medicare requirements when billing for intravitreal injections of Eylea and Lucentis, which accounted for 88 percent of the total payments in our sample.  (All of these injections complied with Medicare requirements except for three injections of Eylea.)  However, the Clinic did not always comply with Medicare requirements when billing for other services provided on the same day as the intravitreal injections (e.g., injections of an anesthesia drug).  For 326 of the 627 services and drugs associated with the 100 sampled beneficiary days, the Clinic complied with the requirements.  However, for the remaining 301 services and drugs, the Clinic did not comply with the requirements: 195 services were not separately payable, and 106 services and drugs were not reasonable and necessary. , Because the Clinic's medical director was unfamiliar with Medicare's billing requirements, the Clinic did not have policies and procedures to ensure that services and drugs billed to Medicare were correctly billed or reasonable and necessary.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that at least $398,625 of the $4.3 million paid to the Clinic for intravitreal injections of Eylea and for other services provided on the same day as intravitreal injections of Eylea and Lucentis was unallowable for Medicare reimbursement.  , We recommend that the Clinic: (1) refund to the Medicare contractor $398,625 in estimated overpayments for intravitreal injections of Eylea and for other services provided on the same day as intravitreal injections of Eylea and Lucentis and (2) based upon the results of this audit, exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule.

548,A-04-19-08072,Risk Assessment of HHS Grant Closeout Procedures A-04-19-08072 03-24-2020,"The Grants Oversight and New Efficiency (GONE) Act, P.L. 114-117, enacted on January 28, 2016, established mandatory reporting requirements for Federal Departments and Inspectors General Offices related to grant awards and cooperative agreements expired for 2 or more years that have not been closed out. GONE Act section 2(c) requires Inspectors General of Departments with greater than $500 million in annual grant funding to conduct a risk assessment of their Departments' grant closeout processes., This risk assessment will fulfill HHS OIG responsibilities under Section 2(c) of the GONE Act.  OIGs are required to report on the risk assessment by March 31, 2020., Our objective was to conduct a risk assessment of the HHS grant closeout process to determine whether an audit of the agency's grant closeout process was warranted; specifically, we assessed the risk that HHS would not meet Federal requirements for grant closeouts. , We focused our review on HHS's internal controls related to grant closeouts.  We interviewed the Office of Assistant Secretary for Financial Resources (ASFR) and Operational Division (OpDiv) officials, reviewed documents, and analyzed the information provided to understand the process used to address the backlog of unclosed grants and identified actions taken and controls implemented at ASFR to prevent a recurrence of the backlog., We determined that an audit of HHS's grant closeout process is not warranted at this time.  Overall, the risk that HHS will not meet Federal requirements for grant closeouts is low.  ASFR and the OPDIVs have responded to the GONE Act requirements by taking significant steps to reduce the HHS-wide backlog of open but expired grants and implementing controls to address the risk of a recurrence of the backlog.  Nevertheless, HHS still faces some challenges in mitigating the risks associated with grant closeouts. Overall, we identified five sub-risk areas as low risk, three as moderate risk, one as high risk, and zero as critical, as summarized in the table below., We recommend that ASFR: work with Payment Management System (PMS) personnel to improve HHS OpDiv grant management offices' access to timely data; work with OpDivs to ensure that personnel are trained in how to obtain and interpret the PMS reports available to them; continue the grant remediation process to close remaining pooled accounts in PMS; work with CMS to implement an electronic grant management system for Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) and Center for Clinical Standards and Quality (CCSQ), assign clear roles and responsibilities related to grant closeout activities at CMCS, and clarify CMCS's ability to close out its grants; and consider revising the HHS regulation at 45 CFR § 75.381 and the GPAM to align closeout time limits for OpDivs with those specified in 2 CFR § 200.343, In written comments on our draft report, ASFR concurred with our recommendations.

Additionally, HHS OIG is required to conduct annual risk assessments of travel card programs to analyze the risks of illegal, improper, and erroneous purchases.  The Charge Card Act also requires that OIG conduct a further review of agency programs that have been assessed as high risk., Under the provisions of the Charge Card Act, we performed a risk assessment of HHS's charge card program for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2017 and identified the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs (IEA) as having a high risk of inappropriate travel card transactions.  , Our objective was to determine whether IEA's travel card program complied with Federal requirements., We reviewed travel card transactions incurred by IEA during FYs 2017 and 2018 and HHS Traveler Agreements and travel training for IEA employees who traveled during FY 2018.  For FY 2017, after removing 10 transactions that were not related to IEA travel, we reviewed 25 transactions identified in the risk assessment as requiring additional review.  For FY 2018, we reviewed a stratified random sample of 89 transactions.  , During our audit period, IEA's travel card program did not always comply with Federal requirements.  Specifically, 58 of the 114 travel transactions (21 of 30 invitational travel transactions and 37 of 84 non-invitational-travel transactions) selected for review did not comply with applicable Federal requirements.  The purpose of invitational travel is to allow requested individuals not employed by the Federal Government or appointed as consultants or experts to confer on Government business.  IEA also did not have signed HHS Traveler Agreements for 17 of the 40 employees who had travel card activity during FY 2018.  Of these 17 cardholders, 2 did not complete the required travel card training course. , These deficiencies occurred because IEA had a high staff turnover rate, and IEA's internal controls were not adequate to ensure that staff, approving officials, and travel card Program Coordinators understood and executed their responsibilities for the travel card program.  , For the FY 2017 transactions that we reviewed, IEA incurred $7,657 in invitational travel expenditures that may have constituted misuse.  In addition, on the basis of our sample results, we estimate that in FY 2018 IEA and its employees may have incurred $50,046 in travel expenditures that constituted misuse or that were otherwise unallowable.  , We made several procedural recommendations, including that IEA develop and distribute to staff a quick reference document that includes key staff responsibilities and requirements to ensure that travel card transactions comply with the Federal Travel Regulation and the HHS Travel Policy Manual.

clinician-reviewers identified instances in which labor and delivery patients received care that did not follow national clinical guidelines or best practices.  We conducted this companion study because most of these instances, although concerning, did not result in patient harm, and therefore do not appear in our main report about adverse events.  Due to the small number of labor and delivery patients included in this review and our sample design, these instances are not projectable to all labor and delivery patients in Indian Health Service (IHS) hospitals., We reviewed medical records associated with 48 labor and delivery patients to identify instances in which providers did not follow national clinical guidelines or best practices.  For each record, an obstetrics nurse and an obstetrician-gynecologist—each with specialized experience in patient safety—assessed whether the care met national clinical guidelines for diagnosing and treating postpartum hemorrhage, induction of labor, delivery via Caesarean section, and diagnosis and treatment of severe hypertension/preeclampsia.  In addition, our reviewer examined whether the diagnosis of postpartum hemorrhage incorporated the best practice of quantitative estimation of blood loss.  We also asked IHS hospitals to describe training for providers of maternal care, and their implementation of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) ""bundles"" of maternal-safety best practices., We found that 27 of 48 labor and delivery patients (56 percent) had some aspect of care that did not follow national clinical guidelines (13 patients), did not use best practices for blood loss estimation (8 patients), or included both concerns (6 patients) during their stays at IHS hospitals., Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the most severe maternal health complications and is rare nationally, affecting about 1 to 3 percent of deliveries.  Among the 48 IHS labor and delivery patients in our sample, 16 patients (33 percent) experienced a postpartum hemorrhage.  Most of these patients—14 of the 16—received care related to the hemorrhage that did not follow national clinical guidelines or best practices.  For some patients, IHS hospital staff did not diagnose the hemorrhage in a timely manner, resulting in delays in treatment that could have reduced the excessive bleeding.  Other instances of care included IHS providers not following national clinical guidelines when inducing labor.  Of the 13 patients in our sample with induced labor, providers did not follow national clinical guidelines for 10 patients, most often related to inappropriate doses of induction medication., IHS has also taken steps to directly address improvement in labor and delivery services via its ongoing implementation of maternal-safety best practice ""bundles,"" or sets of maternal-safety best practices, developed by AIM.  Yet at the time of our review, 3 of the 10 IHS hospitals with labor and delivery units had yet to implement any of the AIM best practice bundles as requested by the IHS Chief Medical Officer., OIG recommends that IHS comprehensively assess its labor and delivery practices and consider changes based on the results of this assessment.  Specific to postpartum hemorrhage, OIG recommends that IHS provide guidance to its hospitals and training to clinicians focused on diagnosing and treating postpartum hemorrhage.  Finally, OIG recommends that IHS encourage and support its hospitals in adopting AIM's maternal-safety best practices.  IHS concurred with our recommendations and described actions it has already taken toward implementation.  These efforts include facility site visits and expanded training.  IHS also reported that all IHS hospitals that provide planned childbirth services have implemented the AIM guidance for postpartum hemorrhage and severe hypertension. "
553,A-06-19-09005,New Mexico Did Not Claim $12.4 Million of $222.6 Million in Medicaid Payments for Services Provided by Indian Health Service Facilities in Accordance With Federal and State Requirements A-06-19-09005 03-14-2022,"While conducting a previous audit in New Mexico, we noted that it had not conducted reconciliations of Indian Health Service (IHS) payments it made to its managed care organizations (MCOs) with actual payments those MCOs made for services provided by IHS facilities.  During our exit conference for that audit, New Mexico said that it had completed the IHS reconciliations, but we did not have an opportunity to review them., Our objective was to determine whether New Mexico claimed IHS expenditures in accordance with Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered $222.6 million in claimed IHS expenditures for the period July 1, 2012, through December 31, 2016 (audit period).  We reviewed New Mexico's reconciliations of claimed and initial IHS expenditures with paid IHS encounter data, verified the accuracy of the IHS encounter data, and conducted a reconciliation of claimed IHS expenditures with paid IHS encounter data for services provided under New Mexico's Salud! and CoLTS waivers (its older waivers)., New Mexico claimed $209.4 million of $222.6 million in IHS expenditures in accordance with Federal and State requirements.  However, New Mexico claimed $12.4 million in IHS expenditures that did not meet Federal and State requirements.  Specifically, New Mexico claimed (1) $6.2 million in unsupported expenditures under its older waivers, which New Mexico did not identify because it did not reconcile initial expenditures with IHS encounter data; (2) $3.6 million in unsupported expenditures under its current waiver because its reconciliations did not account for encounter data adjustments; and (3) $2.6 million in expenditures for encounter data MCOs submitted beyond the 2-year limit outlined in the MCO contracts.  , Additionally, New Mexico may have claimed $750,811 for inpatient encounter data with dates-of-service spans that did not support the number of paid inpatient days., We recommend that New Mexico (1) refund $12.4 million to the Federal Government, (2) work with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to determine the appropriate amount of the additional $750,811 that it should have claimed and refund the Federal share difference, (3) establish policies and procedures to account for adjustments MCOs make to IHS encounter data after reconciliations are completed, and (4) use the entered date to determine whether the MCO submitted an encounter within the 2-year limit.  See the audit report for additional recommendations., In written comments on our draft report, New Mexico concurred with our recommendation that it use the entered date to determine whether the MCO submitted an encounter within the 2-year limit.  New Mexico did not directly address any of our other recommendations but, instead, addressed each of our four findings.  New Mexico concurred with our first and third findings and described actions it had taken to address those two findings.  However, New Mexico did not concur with our second and fourth findings.

554,OEI-05-19-00380,Medicare and Beneficiaries Pay More for Preadmission Services at Affiliated Hospitals Than at Wholly Owned Settings OEI-05-19-00380 12-27-2021,"Medicare's diagnosis related group (DRG) window policy states that if a beneficiary is furnished outpatient hospital services and is admitted to the hospital shortly afterwards for the same condition, the outpatient services are considered part of the admission and included in the pre-set inpatient payment amount rather than resulting in separate payments for the outpatient services.  Since 1990, this policy has covered all settings wholly owned or operated by the admitting hospital., The DRG window policy does not apply to one common hospital ownership structure that is similar to wholly owned or operated settings: affiliated settings.  Affiliated settings are health care settings that are owned by the same affiliated group.  OIG found that in 2019, Medicare paid $168 million and beneficiaries paid approximately $77 million for 3.3 million admission-related outpatient services provided during the DRG-window-covered days at hospitals affiliated with the admitting hospitals.  This total of $245 million for 2019 is more than 5 times the estimated $45 million that Medicare and beneficiaries paid for nearly 800,000 outpatient services related to inpatient admissions at affiliated hospitals when OIG examined this issue in 2011.  Further, beneficiaries who received admission-related outpatient services at affiliated critical access hospitals paid particularly high amounts for those services-about six times as much as beneficiaries who received similar services at other affiliated hospitals.  (Critical access hospitals are a type of small, rural hospital that Medicare reimburses based on the hospital's reasonable costs, which are typically higher than the rates set by prospective payment systems or fee schedules.), Because the DRG window policy does not cover affiliated settings-despite the similarities of those settings to wholly owned settings-beneficiaries who receive admission-related outpatient services at affiliated hospitals must pay separately for those services.  For some beneficiaries-including rural beneficiaries who receive services at critical access hospitals-the costs of these services can be burdensome, with per-beneficiary amounts running into hundreds or thousands of dollars in just a year., We recommend that CMS evaluate the potential impact of updating the DRG window policy to include affiliated hospitals, and that it seek the necessary legislative authority to update the policy as appropriate.  CMS neither concurred nor nonconcurred with our recommendation."
555,OEI-05-19-00410,Opioids in Medicaid: Concerns About Opioid Use Among Beneficiaries in Six Appalachian States OEI-05-19-00410 12-15-2020,"Opioid abuse and overdose deaths remain at crisis levels in the United States generally and in the Appalachian region.  In 2018, an estimated 9.9 million Americans misused prescription opioids, and nearly 47,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses.  In 2017, Appalachian counties had an opioid overdose death rate that was 72 percent higher than in non-Appalachian counties throughout the country.  Further, multiple reports from across the six Appalachian States under review in this data snapshot show dramatic increases in opioid-related overdoses and deaths since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This data snapshot is part of a larger strategy by OIG to fight the opioid crisis and protect beneficiaries from prescription drug misuse and abuse. , We used data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) for six States in the Appalachian region-Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia-to identify beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid who received at least one opioid during 2018.  We determined beneficiaries' morphine equivalent dose, which is a measure that equates all of the various opioids and strengths into one standard value.  We also identified prescribers whose opioid prescribing to beneficiaries at serious risk of misuse or overdose stood out compared to other prescribers., Nearly 6,000 beneficiaries in the 6 Appalachian States received high amounts of opioids and did not have cancer or sickle cell disease and were not in hospice care treatment.  Among those beneficiaries, more than 450 were at serious risk of prescription opioid misuse or overdose.  Nineteen prescribers stood out by prescribing opioids to more beneficiaries at serious risk than others who prescribed opioids to such beneficiaries.  , Medicaid beneficiaries across the six Appalachian States are at risk for opioid misuse or overdose, and the COVID-19 pandemic may be putting Medicaid beneficiaries at greater risk of opioid misuse or overdose in 2020 and beyond.  Specifically, the measures taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the dramatic increases in opioid-related overdoses and deaths in these States since the start of the pandemic.  Additionally, individuals with opioid use disorder could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19 as COVID-19 attacks the lungs, and respiratory disease is known to increase the risk of fatal overdose among people taking opioids., OIG is committed to fighting the opioid crisis and protecting beneficiaries from prescription drug abuse and misuse.  We are working with our law enforcement partners to bring resources and expertise to these six States through the Appalachian Regional Prescription Opioid Strike Force."

557,OEI-04-19-00481,Medicare Market Shares of Diabetes Test Strips From April Through June 2019 OEI-04-19-00481 01-24-2020,"In 2011, CMS implemented a Competitive Bidding Program (CBP) for mail-order diabetes test strips (DTS) in limited areas, and in July 2013, CMS expanded the program nationally to include a national mail-order program (the National Mail-Order Program).  The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) currently prohibits CMS from awarding a CBP contract to a DTS supplier if the supplier's bid does not cover at least 50 percent, by volume, of the DTS types provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  (This is known as the 50-percent rule.)  This rule is intended to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to top-selling DTS via the National Mail-Order Program.  MIPPA requires OIG to determine the Medicare market shares for DTS before each round of bidding.  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the 50 percent rule by requiring that, for bids to furnish DTS on or after January 1, 2019, CMS must use multiple sources of data (from the mail-order and non-mail-order Medicare markets).  OIG's analysis assists CMS in determining whether bidding suppliers meet this 50-percent rule.  Since 2010, OIG has released nine reports evaluating the Medicare market shares for mail-order and non-mail-order DTS.  All CBP contracts expired on December 30, 2018.  In October 2018, CMS issued guidance stating there would be a temporary gap in the CBP beginning January 1, 2019.  CMS has not yet announced when the National Mail-Order Program for DTS will resume being included in the CBP., Using CMS's National Claims History file, we identified the population of Medicare Part B paid claims for DTS that had dates of service beginning between April 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019.  From these populations, we selected a simple random sample of 600 non-mail-order claims and 600 mail-order claims.  We sent documentation requests to the 594 non-mail-order suppliers and the 18 mail-order suppliers associated with the claims in our samples.  We received responses from all 594 non-mail-order suppliers documenting 600 claims in our sample, a 100-percent response rate.  We received responses from 17 mail-order suppliers documenting 599 claims in our sample, a 99-percent response rate.  To estimate the Medicare market share of each type of DTS provided via non-mail order and mail order, we projected our sample data to each of the populations of DTS during the timeframe we reviewed.  , Non mail-order claims composed 85 percent of the total Medicare market for DTS during the time period we reviewed.  The suppliers in our sample provided 25 types of DTS to Medicare beneficiaries via non-mail order and 21 types of DTS via mail order.  The suppliers in our samples provided eight types of DTS to Medicare beneficiaries both via non-mail order and mail order."
558,OEI-06-19-00460,CMS Should Take Further Action To Address States With Poor Performance in Conducting Nursing Home Surveys OEI-06-19-00460 01-14-2022,"CMS oversees how State survey agencies (States) conduct surveys of nursing homes to assess the homes' compliance with Federal requirements.  Recent work by OIG has found problems with performance by some States, which raise questions about the effectiveness of CMS oversight of State performance in conducting nursing home surveys, and the ability of CMS to hold States accountable when problems arise., We analyzed CMS oversight of 52 States (including Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia) during FYs 2015-2018 to identify.  We conducted interviews with CMS staff at the central office and 10 regional offices during February and March 2020, to learn how they work with States to address serious problems with survey performance and any challenges that States may face.  We also collected and analyzed documents from CMS about State performance and CMS imposition of remedies and sanctions on States with poor performance. , Just over half of States-28 of 52-failed to meet the same performance measure or measures in three or four consecutive years during FYs 2015-2018.  States most commonly missed performance measures related to survey timeliness, which CMS and States often attributed to staffing shortages.  Ten percent of States' corrective action plans were missing from CMS files and many others lacked substantive detail.  In addition to corrective action plans, CMS relied on other remedies, such as training and technical assistance, to help States improve performance., Although CMS sometimes imposed financial penalties when States failed to meet the timeliness requirement for surveys, it frequently offset these penalties with one-time funding adjustments.  CMS rarely imposed formal sanctions and has never initiated action to terminate any of its agreements with States for conducting surveys., We recommend that CMS: (1) actively monitor States' corrective action plans, (2) establish guidelines for progressive enforcement actions, (3) engage with senior State officials earlier and more frequently to address problems, and (4) revise the State Operations Manual to reflect current CMS oversight practices.  CMS concurred with these recommendations.  We also recommend that CMS: (5) disseminate the results of State performance reviews more widely.  In response, CMS stated that its current practices already fulfill the recommendation.  We revised the recommendation to clarify the new and expanded dissemination of results we are recommending. "

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth was an important tool for States to increase access to behavioral health services for enrollees in rural or underserved areas with provider shortages.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, States expanded their use of telehealth to help meet the needs of enrollees while also reducing the risks from community spread of the virus.  As the Nation confronts the psychological and emotional impact of COVID-19, the use of telehealth will be important in addressing behavioral health needs for Medicaid enrollees.  , This data brief provides insight into States' challenges as reported in January and February 2020, before the expansion of telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  It provides a useful foundation for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and States by highlighting longstanding challenges with the use of telehealth that existed prior to the additional challenges caused by the pandemic.  Understanding States' challenges with using telehealth to provide behavioral health services can help States improve their Medicaid program and assist enrollees with accessing needed care.  Further, States' expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic has been largely on a temporary basis.  As States consider making telehealth expansions permanent, they can use information in this data brief to develop effective programs and troubleshoot challenges in implementation.  This data brief is a companion report to a data brief that describes the extent to which States evaluate the effects of telehealth on access, cost, and quality of behavioral health services and the extent to which States oversee telehealth for fraud, waste, and abuse., States commonly provide behavioral health services to Medicaid enrollees through managed care organizations.  We conducted a survey of State Medicaid Directors from 37 States that provide behavioral health services via telehealth through managed care organizations.  We also conducted structured interviews with relevant stakeholders.  While we asked about challenges specific to managed care, the respondents focused on States' challenges with using telehealth more generally. , Most States reported multiple challenges with using telehealth, including a lack of training for providers and enrollees, limited internet connectivity for providers and enrollees, difficulties with providers' protecting the privacy and security of enrollees' personal information, and the cost of telehealth infrastructure and interoperability issues for providers.  Some States also reported other challenges, including a lack of licensing reciprocity and difficulties with providers obtaining informed consent from enrollees.  These challenges limit States' ability to use telehealth to meet the behavioral health needs of Medicaid enrollees. , CMS has an important role to play in facilitating the exchange of information among States to improve the use of telehealth for behavioral health services.  Sharing information among States will help ensure that States realize the benefits of telehealth and make informed decisions about how to address challenges with using telehealth.  We recommend that CMS share information to help States address the challenges they face with using telehealth.  This information could include examples from States that describe how they have responded to these challenges.  It could also include best practices from States and information about working with other State and Federal partners.  Further, CMS could collect information from States detailing their experiences and lessons learned in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that address these challenges.  CMS concurred with our one recommendation."

It provides a useful foundation to inform the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and State decisions about how to evaluate the impacts of telehealth on access, cost, and quality of behavioral health services and to strengthen oversight of program integrity.  Evaluating the effects of telehealth on access, cost, and quality is particularly important in helping States make decisions about how to best use telehealth and about which populations benefit most from these services.  Understanding States' efforts to oversee telehealth can help States protect their Medicaid programs.  Further, States' expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic has been largely on a temporary basis.  As States consider making telehealth expansions permanent, States can use information in this data brief to help determine which services best support enrollees.

We also conducted structured interviews with relevant stakeholders.  While we asked about efforts specific to managed care, the respondents focused on States' efforts to evaluate and oversee the use of telehealth more generally. , While most States can identify which services are provided via telehealth, a few reported being unable to, limiting their ability to evaluate and oversee telehealth.  In addition, only a few States have evaluated the effects of telehealth in their State; these States found increased access and reduced costs.  Based on their own experiences, other States believe that telehealth increases access, has uncertain impacts on costs, and raises concerns about quality.  Further, despite concerns about fraud, waste, and abuse, many States do not conduct monitoring and oversight specific to telehealth.  , CMS and State efforts to evaluate and oversee telehealth are critical to meeting Medicaid enrollees' behavioral health needs and to safeguarding the Medicaid program from potential fraud, waste, and abuse.  These efforts are particularly important as the telehealth landscape continues to evolve.  Accordingly, we recommend that CMS: (1) ensure that the three States that are unable to distinguish telehealth from in-person services implement indicators to identify which services are provided via telehealth; (2) conduct evaluations, and support State efforts to evaluate the effects of telehealth on access, cost, and quality of behavioral health services; and (3) conduct monitoring for fraud, waste, and abuse, and support State efforts to oversee telehealth for behavioral health services.  CMS concurred with the first recommendation but did not explicitly indicate whether it concurred with the other two recommendations."
563,A-02-19-01017,New York Verified That Medicaid Assisted Living Program Providers Met Life Safety and Emergency Planning Requirements But Did Not Always Ensure That Assisted Living Program Services Met Federal and State Requirements  A-02-19-01017 02-15-2022,"A 2018 Government Accountability Office report found that improved Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services oversight of State monitoring of Medicaid assisted living services was needed.  We audited New York's Medicaid assisted living program (ALP) to determine whether its oversight and monitoring of ALP providers was effective because we have not conducted an audit of the program since 2006. , In New York, beneficiaries receiving ALP services generally require supervision and personal care to carry out basic activities of daily living.  ALP providers must meet New York's life safety and emergency planning requirements., Our objectives were to determine whether New York verified that ALP providers met life safety and emergency planning requirements for providing Medicaid services and claimed reimbursement for ALP services in accordance with Federal and State requirements., We conducted site visits at five ALP providers to review New York's monitoring and oversight of ALP providers' compliance with life safety and emergency planning requirements.  Our audit covered 195,373 beneficiary-months of ALP services with Federal Medicaid payments totaling $244 million for calendar years 2017 through 2018 (audit period).  We audited a random sample of 100 beneficiary-months of ALP services., New York verified that life safety and emergency planning requirements were met at the five judgmentally selected ALP providers we visited.  However, it claimed reimbursement for some unallowable ALP services during our random sample of 100 beneficiary-months.  Specifically, New York properly claimed Medicaid reimbursement for all ALP services during 91 beneficiary-months and claimed reimbursement for unallowable ALP services during the remaining 9 beneficiary-months.  These deficiencies occurred because New York's monitoring was not sufficient to ensure that ALP providers complied with certain Federal and State requirements for providing, documenting, and billing services.  Despite New York's efforts, some ALP providers did not comply with requirements for (1) documenting beneficiary assessments and care plans and (2) claiming reimbursement only for services in accordance with Medicaid billing requirements and beneficiary care plans., On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that New York improperly claimed at least $1.9 million in Federal Medicaid reimbursement for ALP services during our audit period.  In addition, the health and safety of some Medicaid beneficiaries may have been put at risk because their assessments and care plans were not valid or were missing, and some nurse's aides' qualifications were not documented.  As a result, beneficiaries may have (1) not received ALP services that they were entitled to, (2) received services that were not needed, or (3) received services from some nurse's aides that were not qualified to perform the services furnished. , We recommend that New York refund $1.9 million to the Federal Government.  We also made a series of recommendations for New York to strengthen its oversight and monitoring of its ALP to ensure that providers comply with Federal and State requirements., In written comments on our draft report, New York did not indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with our recommendations.  Under separate cover, New York provided additional documentation regarding some ALP services.   After reviewing New York's comments and the additional documentation, we revised our findings and estimates accordingly.  New York also indicated that it currently performs oversight and monitoring of the ALPs that reflect our recommendations and indicated it plans to issue additional guidance.  We maintain that our findings, as revised, are valid. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
564,A-09-20-03017,Opportunities Exist for CMS and Its Medicare Contractors To Strengthen Program Safeguards To Prevent and Detect Improper Payments for Drug Testing Services A-09-20-03017 06-08-2021,"Patients in active treatment for substance use disorder may also be treated for a variety of medical conditions.  Medicare Part B covers these patients' drug testing services when reasonable and necessary.  For 2019, Medicare paid $180 million for such services provided to 274,000 beneficiaries with substance use disorders nationwide.  Although the 2019 Medicare fee-for-service improper payment rate was 7.3 percent, the improper payment rate was 58.9 percent for the drug test with the highest Medicare fee schedule amount.  We conducted this audit to evaluate how the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and its Medicare contractors addressed the risk for improper payments for drug testing services. , Our objective was to assess the Medicare contractors' program safeguards for ensuring that Medicare claims for drug testing services for beneficiaries with substance use disorders comply with Medicare requirements., Our audit covered Medicare Part B claims for drug testing services provided in 2019 for beneficiaries with substance use disorders.  We interviewed CMS officials and reviewed requirements for drug testing services in all seven Medicare contractors' Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs).  We also interviewed staff from seven selected laboratories and analyzed claims data to determine the potential impact of weaknesses we identified.  , We identified three weaknesses in the Medicare contractors' established program safeguards for preventing and detecting improper payments for drug testing services and promoting provider compliance with Medicare requirements.  Specifically, the contractors did not have: (1) clear and consistent requirements or guidance for laboratories to use when determining the number of drug classes to bill for definitive drug testing services, (2) procedures for identifying or limiting the frequency of drug testing services (e.g., the number of drug tests performed per year) for each beneficiary across all Medicare jurisdictions, and (3) consistent requirements in their LCDs or any procedures for identifying claims for direct-to-definitive drug testing.  If CMS and its contractors cannot ensure that laboratories' claims for drug testing services comply with Medicare requirements, laboratories may receive improper payments, and beneficiaries with substance use disorders may receive medically unnecessary drug testing services., We recommend that CMS work with its Medicare contractors to: (1) take the necessary steps to determine whether clinical evidence exists to support a single, specific reasonable and necessary standard for drug testing services, and if such evidence exists, establish a National Coverage Determination or develop LCDs with more consistent requirements for drug testing services; (2) clearly indicate in LCDs, Local Coverage Articles, or other instructions how laboratories should determine the number of drug classes for billing definitive drug testing services; (3) implement a system edit or procedure to identify and limit the frequency of drug testing services per beneficiary across all Medicare jurisdictions; (4) determine whether a postpayment medical review is necessary for laboratories that have been paid for excessive definitive drug tests (e.g., more than one test) in a 1-week period for the same beneficiary; and (5) consider adding a modifier to claims for definitive drug tests indicating whether a test was based on results obtained from a presumptive drug test., CMS concurred with our fourth and fifth recommendations and provided information on actions that it had taken or planned to take to address them.  However, CMS did not concur with our first three recommendations.  After reviewing CMS's comments, we maintain that these recommendations are valid, but we refined our first and second recommendations.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

We conducted a similar audit of the Ohio Department of Medicaid, which administers the Medicaid program. , Our objective was to determine whether Ohio made capitation payments on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were residing and enrolled in Medicaid in another State., Our audit covered 23,935 August 2018 capitation payments, totaling $12.9 million, made on behalf of beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility in another State during our audit period, July 1 through September 30, 2018.  We selected the middle month of our audit period to ensure that beneficiaries were eligible in the months before and after the August 2018 capitation payments.  We selected a stratified random sample of 104 capitation payments, totaling $47,807 ($34,447 Federal share), and determined whether the beneficiaries were residing and receiving Medicaid benefits in Ohio during the audit period., Ohio made an estimated $5.9 million in August 2018 capitation payments on behalf of beneficiaries who were concurrently eligible and residing in another State.  Of the 104 capitation payments in our stratified random sample, 57 capitation payments were associated with beneficiaries who were residing and eligible for Medicaid benefits in Ohio.  However, for the remaining 47 capitation payments, totaling $24,912 ($17,620 Federal share), Ohio made capitation payments on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have been eligible for Medicaid benefits in Ohio because they were concurrently eligible and residing in another State.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Ohio could have saved $5.9 million ($4.2 million Federal share) for August 2018 capitation payments made to managed care organizations on behalf of beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility., We recommend that Ohio (1) develop or enhance current procedures to identify beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility in another State, which could have saved Ohio an estimated $5.9 million ($4.2 million Federal share) in capitation payments for the month of August 2018, and (2) ensure that procedures are in place for county caseworkers to timely review and terminate eligibility for beneficiaries who were identified as concurrently eligible in another State., In written comments on our draft report, Ohio did not agree or disagree with our findings.  In its comments on our recommendations, Ohio said that it intends to continue the use of Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) files to determine concurrent eligibility.  However, Ohio noted several planned enhancements to limit payments to beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility in another State., Ohio will ensure that PARIS alerts are sent to the counties after the alerts are generated and will ensure the counties' timely processing of these alerts.  Ohio will conduct training covering returned mail procedures, PARIS alerts, and steps that should be taken to properly process a PARIS alert.

We conducted a similar audit of Illinois' Medicaid program., Our objective was to determine whether Illinois made capitation payments on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries who were residing and enrolled in Medicaid in another State., Our audit covered 31,679 August 2018 capitation payments, totaling $10.4 million, made on behalf of beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility in another State during our audit period, July 1 through September 30, 2018.  We selected the middle month of our audit period to ensure that beneficiaries were eligible in the months before and after the August 2018 capitation payments.  We selected a stratified random sample of 100 capitation payments, totaling $33,515 ($20,295 Federal share), and determined whether the beneficiaries were residing and receiving Medicaid benefits in Illinois during the audit period., Illinois made an estimated $3.8 million in August 2018 capitation payments on behalf of beneficiaries who were concurrently eligible and residing in another State.  Of the 100 capitation payments in our stratified random sample, 66 capitation payments were associated with beneficiaries who were residing and eligible for Medicaid benefits in Illinois.  However, for the remaining 34 capitation payments, totaling $11,867 ($6,562 Federal share), Illinois made capitation payments on behalf of beneficiaries who should not have been eligible for Medicaid benefits in Illinois because they were concurrently eligible and residing in another State.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Illinois could have saved $3.8 million ($2.1 million Federal share) for August 2018 capitation payments made to managed care organizations on behalf of beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility.  , We recommend that Illinois (1) develop or enhance current procedures to identify beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility in another State, which could have saved Illinois an estimated $3.8 million ($2.1 million Federal share) in capitation payments for the month of August 2018, and (2) ensure that procedures are in place for caseworkers to timely review and terminate eligibility for beneficiaries who were identified as concurrently eligible in another State., In written comments on our draft report, Illinois accepted our recommendations.  Illinois said that it has implemented Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) matching improvements for all medical beneficiaries and prioritized PARIS match work with eligibility staff.  In addition, Illinois said that it will work to identify and implement strategies to improve the eligibility system's ability to better single out reported address changes to improve processing timeliness.

On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Minnesota could have saved $1.1 million ($665,000 Federal share) for August 2018 capitation payments made to managed care organizations on behalf of beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility., We recommend that Minnesota: (1) develop new procedures or enhance current ones to identify beneficiaries with concurrent eligibility in another State, which could have saved Minnesota an estimated $1.1 million ($665,000 Federal share) in capitation payments for the month of August 2018; and (2) ensure that county caseworkers follow procedures to timely review and terminate eligibility for beneficiaries who were identified as concurrently eligible in another State., In written comments on our draft report, Minnesota accepted our recommendations and described actions it has taken or plans to take to address them.  Specifically, Minnesota said that it will continue to use the Public Assistance Reporting Information System (PARIS) files to determine concurrent eligibility until a successor system is available, but it will review and revise, as necessary, procedures related to recording and acting on changes of address.  Minnesota said that it will remind county and State workers of their responsibilities related to processing PARIS matches and their responsibility to coordinate changes of address across the State's two eligibility systems.

Generally, Part B-covered drugs are those that are injected or infused in physicians' offices or hospital outpatient settings.  The Social Security Act (the Act) mandates that OIG compare ASPs with average manufacturer prices (AMPs).  If OIG finds that the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by a certain percentage (currently 5 percent), the Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to substitute the ASPbased payment amount with a lower calculated rate.  Through regulation, CMS outlined that it would make this substitution only if the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by 5 percent in the two previous quarters or three of the previous four quarters. , Over the last decade, OIG has produced annual reports aggregating the results of our mandated quarterly ASPto-AMP comparisons.  This latest annual report quantifies the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries that are a direct result of CMSs pricesubstitution policy based on 2018 average sales prices.  This report also provides support for a previous OIG recommendation for achieving additional savings., To determine the effects of the pricesubstitution policy, we determined the difference between ASP-based payment and AMP-based payment for each drug with a price substitution.  We then applied this difference to the Medicare utilization for each of these drugs.  To account for a threequarter lag between the reporting of pricing data and applying price substitutions, we used drug utilization data for the fourth quarter of 2018 through the third quarter of 2019 to calculate the savings based on 2018 ASP data. , <p align=""center""><img alt=""A graphic showing the findings of the report"" src=""/oei/reports/OEI-03-20-00130.jpg""/>, OIG has previously recommended that CMS expand the price-substitution criteria.  However, CMS did not concur with expanding the price-substitution policy and expressed concern that expanding price-substitution criteria may impede physician and beneficiary access to drugs.  OIG agrees that access to prescription drugs should always be considered when contemplating pricing policies, and OIG supports current safeguards to prevent substitutions for drugs that the Food and Drug Administration has identified as being in short supply.  However, OIG continues to believe that CMS can achieve a better balance between safeguarding access to drugs and ensuring that Medicare and its beneficiaries do not overpay for drugs.  , CMS responded that it continues to not concur with our recommendation.  CMS reported that, as additional data becomes available and as it continues to gain experience with the pricesubstitution policy, it will consider further changes as necessary.  CMS also stated that the current policy safeguards—which identify drugs that exceed the 5-percent threshold for two consecutive quarters or three of four quarters—identify drugs that consistently exceed the threshold.

578,OEI-BL-20-00100,Loophole in Drug Payment Rule Continues To Cost Medicare and Beneficiaries Hundreds of Millions of Dollars OEI-BL-20-00100 07-02-2020,"With certain exceptions, self-administered drugs are typically not covered under Medicare       Part B.  However, in a November 2017 report, OIG found that CMS and a Federal court interpret relevant statute to require the inclusion of versions of drugs not generally covered under Part B in limited circumstances when setting Medicare payment amounts.  As a result, CMS included noncovered, self-administered versions of Orencia and Cimzia when determining payments for those two drugs.  The inclusion of these noncovered versions caused Medicare and its beneficiaries to pay an extra $366 million from 2014 through 2016.  OIG recommended that CMS seek a legislative change that would provide the agency with flexibility to determine when noncovered versions of a drug should be included in the calculation of the Part B payment amount.  CMS did not concur with our recommendation and, to date, no action has been taken to close the payment loophole.  , To determine whether there were any additional drugs (beyond the two identified in our previous report) for which noncovered versions were being used to set Part B payment amounts in 2017 or 2018, OIG used data from CMS, FDA, and drug manufacturers.  To assess the financial impact of the loophole, we recalculated the Part B payment amount for each drug excluding the self-administered versions.  We then multiplied the total Part B expenditures for the drug each quarter by the percentage reduction that would have been achieved with the alternate payment amount., As of December 2019, CMS continued to include noncovered, self-administered versions when calculating Part B payment amounts for Orencia and Cimzia, the same two drugs identified in OIG's November 2017 report.  From our analysis, these two drugs were the only ones for which noncovered, self-administered versions were used to set Part B payment amounts in 2017 or 2018.  Closing the payment loophole for self-administered drugs would have saved Medicare and its beneficiaries nearly half a billion dollars on Orencia and Cimzia in 2017 and 2018.  Further, OIG found that physicians almost never administered the self-injected versions of Orencia to patients in their offices, and that the payment loophole may give physicians substantial incentives to administer Orencia and Cimzia instead of other drugs for the same conditions., OIG continues to recommend that CMS seek a legislative change requiring that noncovered, self-administered versions of drugs be excluded in the calculation of Part B payment amounts.  Given the complexities inherent in identifying such versions, it is critical that any legislation address decisions points in the process, particularly the sources and evidence that CMS may use."
579,OEI-03-19-00430,CMS's Encounter Data Lack Essential Information That Medicare Advantage Organizations Have the Ability to Collect OEI-03-19-00430 08-24-2020,"National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) for physicians and nonphysician practitioners who order and/or refer services (ordering providers) are essential for safeguarding the program integrity of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS); clinical laboratory services; imaging services; and home health services in Medicare.  NPIs are critical for identifying inappropriate billing and ordering patterns among providers and investigating fraud and abuse.  Both CMS and OIG rely on NPIs for ordering providers to conduct oversight and pursue fraud investigations.  Prior OIG work found that ordering provider NPIs were absent from 63 percent of Medicare Advantage (MA) encounter records for DMEPOS and for laboratory, imaging, and home health services, and recommended that CMS establish and enforce requirements for MA Organizations (MAOs) to submit ordering provider NPIs for these types of items and services.  Findings from our survey of MAOs may be useful as CMS weighs the program integrity benefits of requiring NPIs for ordering providers against the potential burden that MAOs would experience from establishing and enforcing these requirements., To determine the extent to which MAOs submitted ordering provider NPIs on encounter records for DMEPOS and for laboratory, imaging, and home health services, we extracted and analyzed 2018 MA encounter data from CMS's Integrated Data Repository in February 2020.  We also sent an online survey to a stratified random sample of 200 MAOs.  We received responses from 179 MAOs.  , CMS's MA encounter data continue to lack ordering provider NPIs on records for DMEPOS and for laboratory, imaging, and home health services.  However, we found that almost all MAOs have data systems that are able to receive and store these NPIs when providers submit them to MAOs on claims or encounter records.  In addition, a substantial portion of MAOs reported that providers are already submitting the ordering provider NPIs on claims or encounter records for DMEPOS, laboratory services, and imaging services.  Further, a majority of MAOs require NPIs to be submitted for their other lines of business (such as commercial and private health insurance, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program).  Finally, almost half of MAOs believe that NPIs for ordering providers are critical for combating fraud., OIG recommends that CMS require MAOs to submit the ordering provider NPI on encounter records for DMEPOS and for laboratory, imaging, and home health services; and establish and implement ""reject edits"" that (1) reject encounter records in which the ordering provider NPI is not present when required and (2) reject encounter records that contain an ordering provider NPI that is not a valid and active NPI in the NPPES registry.  CMS concurred with the first recommendation but did not concur with the second recommendation. "

Our review covered the 3-year period of fiscal years 2016 through 2018.  We based our inspection on an analysis of data and information from 7 sources: (1) Unit documentation; (2) financial documentation; (3) structured interviews with key stakeholders; (4) structured interviews with the Unit's managers and selected staff; (5) a review of a random sample of 56 case files from the 96 nonglobal case files that were open at some point during the review period; (6) a review of all convictions submitted to OIG so that convicted individuals could be excluded from Federal health care programs and all adverse actions submitted to the National Practitioner Data Bank during the review period; and (7) observation of Unit operations., Based on the information we reviewed, we found that the Unit operated in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policy transmittals.  However, we made two findings involving the Unit's adherence to Performance Standard 7.  We found that the Unit lacked a central repository for case information, making access to case data and pertinent case documents inefficient.  We also found that the Unit's practices for conducting periodic supervisory review were not fully reflected in its policies and procedures manual., We recommend that, to address the two findings, the Montana Unit: (1) implement a comprehensive case management system that allows for efficient access to case documents and information; and (2) revise its policies and procedures manual to address the frequency of its periodic supervisory reviews.

In 2015, OIG issued a report from its 2014 onsite review of the MFCU that raised concerns about the Unit's ability to carry out its statutory functions and meet program requirements.  To address the deficiencies identified during OIG's previous onsite review, the MFCU developed and implemented a corrective action plan.  Despite this effort, we found that the Hawaii MFCU's case outcomes were low during FYs 2016-18, compared to other similarly sized MFCUs., We conducted the onsite review of the Hawaii MFCU in March 2019.  Our review period covered FYs 2016-18.  We based our review on an analysis of data from seven sources: (1) Unit documentation, such as policies and procedures; (2) structured interviews with key stakeholders; (3) structured interviews with Unit managers and selected staff; (4) a review of a random sample of case files open at some point during the review period; (5) referrals received by the Unit; 
(6) observation of Unit operations; and (7) documentation associated with the Unit's fiscal controls., We identified several contributing factors in three areas that affected the Hawaii MFCU's low case outcomes during FYs 2016-18.  We found that the MFCU received few fraud referrals from the Medicaid Program Integrity Unit and other stakeholders, which limited the number of cases available for the Unit to investigate and prosecute.  The Unit also experienced significant turnover of investigators and lacked sufficient Medicaid fraud cases to adequately train new and inexperienced investigators.  Additionally, we found that the MFCU's agreement with Adult Protective and Community Services Branch (referred to as Adult Protective Services) for processing patient abuse and neglect complaints was structured in such a way that it led to the Unit screening thousands of complaints unsuitable for investigation, which diverted the Unit's time and resources from working viable cases with substantial potential for criminal prosecution., To address the issues identified in this report and improve case outcomes, we recommend that the Unit (1) develop and implement a plan to increase Medicaid fraud referrals from the Medicaid agency and other stakeholders; (2) develop and expedite an in-house Medicaid fraud training program for Unit investigators; and (3) revise the Unit's agreement with Adult Protective Services to establish minimum criteria for a complaint to be sent to the MFCU.  The Unit concurred with all three recommendations."

Accordingly, MA organizations are paid more for providing benefits to enrollees with diagnoses associated with more intensive use of health care resources than to healthier enrollees who would be expected to require fewer health care resources., For this audit, we reviewed one MA organization, Anthem Community Insurance Company, Inc. (Anthem), and focused on seven groups of high-risk diagnosis codes.  Our objective was to determine whether selected diagnosis codes that Anthem submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program complied with Federal requirements., We sampled 203 unique enrollee-years with the high-risk diagnosis codes for which Anthem received higher payments for 2015 through 2016.  We limited our review to the portions of the payments that were associated with these high-risk diagnosis codes, which totaled $599,842., With respect to the seven high-risk groups covered by our audit, most of the selected diagnosis codes that Anthem submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program did not comply with Federal requirements.  For 123 of the 203 enrollee-years, the diagnosis codes that Anthem submitted to CMS were not supported in the medical records and resulted in $354,016 of net overpayments for the 203 enrollee-years., These errors occurred because the policies and procedures that Anthem had to detect and correct noncompliance with CMS's program requirements, as mandated by Federal regulations, were not always effective.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Anthem received at least $3.47 million of net overpayments for these high-risk diagnosis codes in 2015 and 2016., We recommend that Anthem refund to the Federal Government the $3.47 million of net overpayments; identify, for the high-risk diagnoses included in this report, similar instances of noncompliance that occurred before or after our audit period and refund any resulting overpayments to the Federal Government; and enhance its compliance procedures to focus on diagnosis codes that are at high risk for being miscoded by (1) determining whether these diagnosis codes (when submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program) comply with Federal requirements and (2) educating its providers about the proper use of these diagnosis codes., Anthem did not concur with our findings and recommendations.  Anthem disagreed with our findings for 2 specific enrollee-years and provided additional explanations.  Anthem also did not agree with the methodologies that we used to review the selected diagnoses and to calculate the $3.47 million of net overpayments.

Our objective was to determine whether selected diagnosis codes that UPMC submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program complied with Federal requirements.  , We sampled 280 unique enrollee-years with the high-risk diagnosis codes for which UPMC received higher payments for 2015 through 2016.  We limited our review to the portions of the payments that were associated with these high-risk diagnosis codes, which totaled $975,223., With respect to the 10 high-risk groups covered by our audit, most of the selected diagnosis codes that UPMC submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program did not comply with Federal requirements.  For 194 of the 280 enrollee-years, the diagnosis codes that UPMC submitted to CMS were not supported in the medical records and resulted in $681,099 of net overpayments for the 194 enrollee-years., These errors occurred because the policies and procedures that UPMC had to ensure compliance with CMS's program requirements, as mandated by Federal regulations, were not always effective.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that UPMC received at least $6.4 million of net overpayments for these high-risk diagnosis codes in 2015 and 2016., We recommend that UPMC refund to the Federal Government the $6.4 million of estimated net overpayments; identify, for the high-risk diagnoses included in this report, similar instances of noncompliance that occurred before or after our audit period and refund any resulting overpayments to the Federal Government; and continue its examination of existing compliance procedures to identify areas where improvements can be made to ensure that diagnosis codes that are at high risk for being miscoded comply with Federal requirements (when submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program) and take the necessary steps to enhance those procedures., UPMC disagreed with our findings and recommendations.  UPMC provided additional information which, according to UPMC, validated HCCs for 25 sampled enrollee-years.  UPMC questioned both our audit methodology and the qualifications of our independent medical review contractor.  UPMC also stated that we did not calculate overpayments according to CMS requirements and that it disagreed with our extrapolation methodology and our assessment of its compliance program.  After reviewing UPMC's comments and the additional information that it provided, we revised the number of enrollee-years in error for this final report.  We followed a reasonable audit methodology, used a qualified medical review contractor, correctly applied applicable Federal requirements underlying the MA program, and properly assessed UPMC's compliance program.  We revised the amount in our first recommendation from $6.6 million (in our draft report) to $6.4 million but made no change to our other recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

Some diagnoses are at higher risk for being miscoded, which may result in overpayments from CMS. , For this audit, we reviewed one MA organization, Coventry Health Care of Missouri, Inc. (Coventry), and focused on six groups of high-risk diagnosis codes.  Our objective was to determine whether selected diagnosis codes that Coventry submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program complied with Federal requirements., We judgmentally selected 275 unique enrollee-years with the high-risk diagnosis codes for which Coventry received higher payments for 2014 through 2016.  We limited our review to the portions of the payments that were associated with these high-risk diagnosis codes, which totaled $701,593., Most of the selected diagnosis codes that Coventry submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program did not comply with Federal requirements.  For 226 of the 275 enrollee-years, the diagnosis codes that Coventry submitted to CMS were not supported in the medical records., These errors occurred because the policies and procedures that Coventry had to detect and correct noncompliance with CMS's program requirements, as mandated by Federal regulations, were not always effective.

However, Coventry did not agree with the other findings associated with our first recommendation and submitted additional documentation for our consideration.  Coventry did not agree with our other recommendations and said that our report contained a number of serious flaws that fundamentally undermined our audit methodology, findings, and recommendations.  Coventry also stated that it had made enhancements to its compliance processes since our audit period, including provider education., After reviewing Coventry's comments and the additional documentation that it provided, we revised the number of enrollee-years in error.  We followed a reasonable audit methodology, properly executed our sampling methodology, and correctly applied applicable Federal requirements underlying the MA program.  We revised the recommendation to refund overpayments from $584,005 (in our draft report) to $548,852 and slightly revised some of the language in our third recommendation., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

We limited our review to the portions of the payments that were associated with these high-risk diagnosis codes, which totaled $746,427., Most of the selected diagnosis codes that Tufts submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program did not comply with Federal requirements.  For 58 of the 212 sampled enrollee-years, the medical records validated the reviewed Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCCs).  However, for the remaining 154 enrollee-years, the diagnosis codes were not supported in the medical records.  These errors occurred because the policies and procedures that Tufts had to ensure compliance with CMS's program requirements, as mandated by Federal regulations, could be improved.  As a result, the HCCs for some of the high-risk diagnosis codes were not validated.  On the basis of our sample results, we estimated that Tufts received at least $3.7 million of net overpayments for these high-risk diagnosis codes in 2015 and 2016., We recommend that Tufts: (1) refund to the Federal Government the $3.7 million of net overpayments; (2) identify, for the high-risk diagnoses included in this report, similar instances of noncompliance that occurred before or after our audit period and refund any resulting overpayments to the Federal Government; and (3) continue to improve its existing compliance procedures to identify areas where improvements can be made to ensure diagnosis codes that are at high risk for being miscoded comply with Federal requirements (when submitted to CMS for use in CMS's risk adjustment program) and take the necessary steps to enhance those procedures., Tufts did not concur with our findings and recommendations. Tufts stated that we should not have included the errors associated with 5 enrollee-years in our calculation of total net overpayments because, according to Tufts, it had already submitted corrections to CMS.  Tufts did not specifically comment on the errors associated with the other 154 enrollee-years.  Tufts disagreed with our sampling and review methodologies, and stated that our report reflected misunderstandings of legal and regulatory requirements underlying the MA program., After consideration of Tufts' comments, we maintain that our findings and recommendations are valid.  However, we revised our findings for the 5 enrollee-years and considered the impact of the budget sequestration reduction; therefore, we reduced our first recommendation from $4,013,034 to $3,758,335 for our final report.

Title IV provided $5 million for the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), to conduct oversight of the UAC Program.  On January 31, 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, the Secretary of HHS declared a public health emergency.  Following this declaration, Congress appropriated $12 million to HHS-OIG to conduct oversight of HHS's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  , Previous HHS-OIG work has focused on the Office of Refugee Resettlement's (ORR's) efforts to ensure the health and safety of children in the UAC Program, including when the UAC Program experiences a sudden change in the number or needs of children.  This report builds on our oversight of ORR's efforts to protect children and is one of two reports addressing emergency preparedness at ORR facilities.  This report specifically addresses communicable disease preparedness., Our objective was to determine whether ORR ensured that selected care provider facilities (facilities) followed ORR requirements in preparing for and responding to communicable diseases, such as COVID-19., We conducted this communicable disease preparedness audit of 11 selected facilities from March through June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  Because most States were under stay-at-home orders, we sent questionnaires to the 11 selected care providers and requested documentation from each.  We also interviewed ORR regarding its oversight responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic., ORR ensured that the 11 facilities we selected for review followed ORR requirements in preparing for and responding to communicable diseases and were prepared to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, ORR provided detailed COVID-19-response guidance, encouraged telehealth visits, and updated the UAC Portal., The 11 selected facilities that we reviewed were generally prepared to respond to an emergency event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with Federal guidance.  Specifically, they had policies and procedures, the capability to quarantine COVID-19 cases in their facilities, and adequate personal protective equipment.  , ORR officials stated that, since 2006, ORR has had a policy in place that required its facilities to prepare for and respond to a communicable disease outbreak; therefore, the facilities were generally able to quickly pivot to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. , This report contains no recommendations., In response to our draft report, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) stated that ORR's standard operating procedures for communicable diseases follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) surveillance and outbreak guidelines for each specific disease.  ACF also stated that ORR will continue to monitor the situation around COVID-19 and coordinate all response efforts with CDC and local public health officials.

More than 13 million beneficiaries are served by long-term-care facilities each year, including the elderly, individuals in hospice care, and individuals with intellectual disabilities.  , The National Background Check Program (Program), enacted by legislation in 2010, assists States in developing and improving systems to conduct Federal and State background checks.  Included in this legislation is a mandate that OIG produce an evaluation of the Program within 180 days of Program completion.  This report is the fourth in a series to supplement the mandated evaluation.  In future work, we will assess the final four States to conclude the Program and the Program overall., We reviewed grant-monitoring documents and financial reports to determine the extent to which the 4 States that concluded participation in 2019 had implemented 13 selected Program requirements.  Additionally, we surveyed program staff from the four States to collect information on their experiences with their respective background check programs., OIG found that of the 4 States that concluded their participation in the Program in 2019, 3 States-Hawaii, Oregon, and Puerto Rico-did not implement all 13 selected Program requirements during the grant period.  These States had varying degrees of State-level legal requirements and practical infrastructure for conducting background checks that affected their ability to implement select Program requirements.  Primarily, these States lacked existing legislative authority and encountered challenges in coordinating between State-level departments.  Two States needed to seek legislative authority to implement select Program requirements and develop needed infrastructure.  One State needed to amend existing legislation to implement one Program requirement.  The two States that needed to seek legislative authority also encountered challenges in coordinating with their respective State criminal justice authorities to implement background check requirements.  One State had existing legislative authority and implemented all 13 selected Program requirements. , OIG found that three of the four States-Ohio, Oregon, and Puerto Rico-did not report sufficient data to accurately assess Program outcomes.  Unless all participating States consistently report quality data, Program outcomes cannot be accurately assessed., CMS should continue to implement OIG's prior recommendation for it to take appropriate actions to encourage States to obtain the necessary legislative authority to fully implement Program requirements.  Given this report's findings, CMS should assist participating States to address the challenge of coordinating between State-level departments and require participating States to consistently submit data that allow for CMS and each State to calculate determinations of ineligibility.  CMS concurred with both recommendations."

SAMHSA was authorized to award $1 billion in funding for fiscal years (FYs) 2017 and 2018.  These grants included the Tribal Opioid Response (TOR) grants.  The purposes of these grants were to increase access to treatment, reduce unmet treatment needs, and reduce opioid overdose-related deaths through prevention, treatment, and recovery services for OUD., Our objective was to determine whether the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma met program goals and complied with Federal regulations in administering its TOR grant., The Choctaw Nation was awarded the TOR grant for the period September 30, 2018, through September 29, 2020.  Our audit period was the first grant year., To determine whether the Choctaw Nation met program goals, we reviewed the Tribe's grant application, needs assessment, strategic action plan, annual progress reports, and source documents for programs implemented during the first grant year.  We then compared those programs against the requirements in SAMHSA's Funding Opportunity Announcement and determined whether the Tribe made progress or implemented programs in accordance with the TOR grant goals and requirements., The Choctaw Nation met some program goals for its TOR grant during the first grant year.  Specifically, the Choctaw Nation met program goals in the areas of prevention and recovery.  The Choctaw Nation also made progress toward meeting treatment program goals but encountered some challenges that prevented it from increasing the availability of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) services for Tribal members within its health care system.  The Choctaw Nation was unable to achieve one of its goals during the first grant year: to send a provider to a 12-month addiction and pain management fellowship to obtain credentialing as an Addiction Medicine Specialist.  Although the Choctaw Nation was unable to establish MAT services by enrolling a provider in this addiction and pain management fellowship, the Tribe instead sent some of its current providers to become MAT waiver trained., The Choctaw Nation generally complied with Federal cost principles when administering its TOR grant.  However, during the first grant year the Choctaw Nation claimed a cost of $2,405 to the TOR grant that was unallowable.  A contractor submitted one invoice for work performed on the grant that included the cost of a chartered flight, and the Choctaw Nation charged the entire invoice amount to the grant award.  The cost of the chartered flight was unallowable because it was unreasonable.  This error occurred because the Choctaw Nation's policies and procedures did not clearly delineate responsibilities of departments in assessing the allowability of costs in the context of applicable Federal requirements on invoices submitted by the contractor., We recommend that the Choctaw Nation refund unallowable costs of $2,405 to the TOR grant.  We also make procedural recommendations to the Choctaw Nation to train staff to identify contract costs that are allowable under Federal regulations and strengthen or establish policies and procedures regarding Tribal departmental responsibilities and staff access to contractual agreements. , Although the Choctaw Nation did not directly agree or disagree with our recommendations, it described corrective actions it took that were in keeping with our recommendations.  The Choctaw Nation said that it received a refund from the contractor for the unallowable costs and used the returned funds on allowable expenditures.  The Choctaw Nation added that it has implemented a more stringent process to review costs charged to the grant and a system where contracts can be accessed by any necessary party., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/samhsa.asp"">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>"

These grants included the Opioid State Targeted Response (STR) and the State Opioid Response (SOR) grants.  The purposes of these grants were to increase access to treatment, reduce unmet treatment needs, and reduce opioid overdose-related deaths. , Our objective was to determine how Louisiana implemented programs under the Opioid STR and SOR grants and whether the activities of Louisiana entities responsible for implementing the programs complied with Federal regulations and met grant program goals., Our audit period covered May 1, 2017, through October 31, 2019, for the STR grant and September 30, 2018, through September 29, 2019, the first year of the SOR grant.  To accomplish our audit objective, we reviewed STR and SOR grant documentation and interviewed Louisiana officials to determine how programs were implemented and whether Louisiana complied with Federal regulations and met grant program goal requirements during the audit., Louisiana implemented STR grant programs by expanding prevention, treatment, and recovery services for opioid use disorder.  However, we found that Louisiana faced challenges in complying with Federal regulations related to reporting and oversight.  Additionally, Louisiana met program goals of the STR grant for prevention, treatment, and recovery services, but did not adequately address challenges it faced meeting grant terms.  , During the first year of the SOR grant, Louisiana implemented a collaborative approach to enhance and expand the capacity of treatment providers.  Louisiana created crisis mobile teams to increase outreach to community programs by partnering with the Local Governing Entities (LGEs) and expanded access to recovery support services by increasing safe recovery housing.  Louisiana complied with Federal regulations related to the SOR grant.  However, we found that it did not meet treatment services and naloxone distribution goals during the first year of its SOR grant., We recommend that Louisiana (1) develop a process to ensure accurate reporting on the Annual Progress Reports, (2) improve monitoring of subrecipients to ensure that distribution of naloxone kits are tracked and distribution requirements are met, (3) work with the LGEs and Opioid Treatment Programs to identify ways to support clients' access to transportation to obtain treatment and determine how transportation could be addressed in each specific region of the State, and (4) review the contracting process to determine whether there are ways to expedite the process to provide funds to subrecipients and outside organizations in a timely manner. , In written comments on our draft report, Louisiana concurred with most of our findings and all of our recommendations.  Louisiana stated that it had hired a data analyst to monitor the integrity of data for consistent and accurate reporting.  Louisiana also stated that it had developed a workgroup to help expedite the contract review process and is hiring additional staff to review contracts for accuracy.  OBH disagreed with our findings that it had no assurance naloxone kits were distributed to target populations and that it did not adequately address transportation challenges.  We maintain that our findings are valid and provide further information in the report.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/samhsa.asp"">Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a>"
594,A-01-20-00501,Medicare Could Have Saved Approximately $993 Million in 2017 and 2018 if It Had Implemented an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Transfer Payment Policy for Early Discharges to Home Health Agencies A-01-20-00501 12-07-2021,"In their 2020 report, the Trustees of the Part A Hospital Insurance Trust Fund urged policymakers to take timely and effective action to address projected deficits that could lead to Medicare Part A deficits of $9.6 billion by 2026.  The Trustees stated in their report that the sooner significant reforms were enacted, the more flexible and gradual the reforms could be.  We performed this audit because an audit regarding the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) early transfer payment policies for hospitals to hospice care indicated that significant savings could be realized for the Medicare program if CMS implemented an inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) transfer payment policy for early discharges to home health agencies (HHAs).  Our prior work resulted in Congress enacting a hospital early discharge to hospice policy that went into effect on October 1, 2018., Our objective was to determine how much Medicare could have saved in calendar years (CYs) 2017 and 2018 if CMS had expanded the IRF transfer payment policy to include early discharges to home health care., For IRF stays that occurred in CYs 2017 and 2018, 1,152 IRFs submitted 802,275 claims with payments totaling $16.1 billion.  Of these claims, our audit covered 230,725 IRF claims with payments totaling $4.8 billion for stays that ended in early discharges to home health care (i.e., the length of the IRF stay was more than 3 days but less than the case-mix group average length of stay and the actual HHA claim date of service was within 3 days of the IRF discharge date).  We calculated the savings CMS would have realized for these claims if the transfer payment policy had covered discharges to home health.  We used claims with a date of service within 3 days of the IRF discharge date for our calculations to be consistent with CMS regulations for discharges from acute-care hospitals to home health care., In addition, we compared the payments that would have been made under an expanded transfer policy with the IRFs' calculated costs to provide care.  To do so, we calculated the IRFs' transfer payments and compared them with the IRFs' costs to provide care., Medicare could have saved approximately $993 million in CYs 2017 and 2018 if CMS had expanded its IRF transfer payment policy to apply to early discharges to home health care.  We determined that this payment policy would generally result in payments to IRFs that would cover their costs to provide care.  When CMS announced its proposed IRF transfer payment policy in 2001, it stated that it would analyze claims data to compare billing patterns prior to and after its implementation and refine IRF payments in the future, if warranted.  For this audit, CMS officials did not explain why CMS has not expanded the IRF transfer payment policy to cover discharges to home health care.  CMS also did not analyze claims data to compare billing patterns prior to and after the implementation of the PPS for IRFs in January 2002, which could have provided information in support of expanding the IRF transfer payment policy to include early discharges to home health care., We recommend that CMS take the necessary steps to establish an IRF transfer payment policy for early discharges to home health care.  If this expanded policy had been in place, Medicare could have saved $993,134,059 in 2017 and 2018., CMS stated that it will consider our recommendation when determining the appropriate next steps for the IRF prospective payment system.  It said that expanding the IRF transfer payment policy would require notice and comment rulemaking, and that the policy developed during a notice and comment period would ultimately determine any potential savings., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

CMS recently made substantive changes to its PERM program, which included hiring a contractor to perform PERM eligibility reviews.  In addition, prior OIG audits have identified Medicaid eligibility determinations as a high-risk area. , The objective of this audit was to assess the adequacy of the PERM program by determining whether CMS's contractor conducted eligibility reviews for selected States in accordance with Federal and State requirements., Our audit covered 1,311 Medicaid claims reviewed by CMS's eligibility review contractor, totaling over $1.9 million (Federal share), included in the eligibility review component of the Reporting Year 2019 PERM program for 3 States.  We judgmentally selected these States based on various factors, including total Medicaid payments, individual State eligibility error rates, and the types of eligibility errors identified by CMS's eligibility review contractor.  We reviewed a random sample of 100 Medicaid claims (total) for the 3 States., We determined that CMS's eligibility review contractor correctly determined Medicaid eligibility for the beneficiaries associated with all 100 sampled claims.

We are issuing this data brief because wage index accuracy is essential to the primary objective of the inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS and OPPS), which is to create incentives for hospitals to operate efficiently, while ensuring that payments are adequate to compensate hospitals for the reasonable costs of high-quality, necessary care.  If hospitals are undercompensated because of inaccurate wage indexes, that puts them under financial stress, which could lead to a variety of adverse outcomes, up to and including closure.  , The objective of this audit is to analyze certain characteristics of the hospitals with area wage indexes (AWIs) in the bottom quartile for 2020 to provide information to CMS and other stakeholders during the implementation of CMS's bottom quartile wage index adjustment. We are providing the results of this audit in the form of a data brief to best present our results at this stage in the anticipated 4-year period during which CMS plans to adjust the wage indexes in the bottom quartile., CMS calculates AWIs annually and uses those AWIs to adjust Medicare standard payments to hospitals in the inpatient and outpatient prospective payment systems to reflect the prices hospitals face in their local labor markets.  Researchers and stakeholders use the term ""circularity"" to refer to the fact that CMS calculates the current year's AWIs based on wage data submitted by hospitals in their Medicare cost reports.  Those wage data are approximately 4 years old when used by CMS to calculate wage indexes.  Critics of circularity (or rather of circularity combined with that 4-year time lag) assert that it can prevent some hospitals from raising wages.  , For 2020 (Federal fiscal year (FFY) for inpatient claims and calendar year for outpatient claims), CMS raised AWIs in the bottom quartile (the lowest 25 percent) to bring them closer to the 25th percentile wage index.  CMS did this because, in its opinion, the wage index system had previously been perpetuating and exacerbating low wage indexes because of circularity combined with the 4-year time lag, as described above.  Accordingly, CMS has stated that it intends to employ this new tactic of raising the wage indexes in the bottom quartile each year for at least 4 years, with the expectation that the hospitals in the bottom quartile will use the opportunity afforded by higher Medicare payments to raise wages.  , When post-pandemic conditions allow for new initiatives, CMS could consider focusing the bottom quartile wage index adjustment more precisely toward the hospitals that are the least able to raise wages without that adjustment.  Those hospitals are the ones with low or negative profit margins rather than higher, positive profit margins.  CMS could also consider studying the question of why some hospitals in a particular area were able to pay higher wages than other hospitals in the same area prior to the implementation of the bottom quartile wage index adjustment.  More information might enable CMS to focus the adjustment even more precisely., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
598,OEI-BL-20-00080,High-expenditure Medicare drugs often qualified for Orphan Drug Act incentives designed to encourage the development of treatments for rare diseases OEI-BL-20-00080 09-28-2021,"Over 7,000 rare diseases affect more than 30 million Americans.  The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) provides financial incentives—such as tax incentives and an exemption from marketing application fees—to encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases or conditions for which treatments might not be developed otherwise.  If a drug is approved for marketing of an orphan indication, the manufacturer is generally eligible for 7 years of market exclusivity for the approved orphan indication.  As a result, manufacturers have received approval for hundreds of orphan drugs that provide a benefit to previously overlooked populations.  However, research has shown that some manufacturers increase profits for their orphan drugs by setting high launch prices and subsequently seeking approval for multiple orphan indications or by repurposing high-revenue mass-market drugs to acquire certain ODA incentives. Researchers' critiques of the ODA raise questions concerning potential unintended effects on manufacturers' behaviors and whether a realignment of eligibility requirements and incentives, at least in certain instances, may be warranted.  OIG's analysis aims to provide stakeholders with relevant information on a specific subset of high-expenditure drugs that have qualified for ODA incentives.  , We selected a purposive sample of 40 drugs—20 with the highest expenditures in Medicare Part B and 20 with the highest expenditures in Medicare Part D.  We determined how many of these high-expenditure drugs were orphan drugs (i.e., had at least one orphan designation) as of March 2020.  We also reviewed the rare diseases or conditions for which the orphan drugs had been granted orphan designations and the approved indications within those diseases.  Lastly, we determined the extent to which these orphan drugs were utilized for their approved orphan indications.  , A majority of the highest-expenditure drugs in Medicare—some of the best-selling drugs in the world—have been granted at least one orphan designation, qualifying their manufacturers for ODA financial incentives.  Some of these orphan drugs have managed to generate significant Medicare expenditures and billions of dollars in annual revenue while treating only rare diseases and conditions.  However, orphan drugs are not limited to the treatment of rare diseases or conditions.  Although the vast majority of orphan drugs treat only rare diseases or conditions, many of the high-expenditure orphan drugs included in our review were originally approved—and are still primarily used—to treat relatively common diseases or conditions.  Furthermore, orphan drug exclusion from the 340B Drug Pricing Program may provide significant financial incentives for manufacturers to seek orphan designation for drugs approved to treat common diseases or conditions. , On one hand, the examples highlighted in our findings may illustrate the ODA functioning as intended.  By encouraging manufacturers to study whether existing drugs could also be used to treat rare diseases and conditions, the financial incentives offered under the ODA subsidize manufacturers' investment costs for numerous presumptively unprofitable orphan indications.  From another perspective, our findings raise questions for further consideration, including the following:, This report provides an independent analysis on a specific subset of orphan drugs—those with the highest Medicare expenditures-and serves to both inform ongoing discussions and support congressional and decisionmakers' efforts to improve the Orphan Drug Program.  OIG encourages the policymaking, oversight, and research communities to seek answers to the additional questions raised by our findings.  In debating any potential changes, it will be vital to ensure that the program continues to successfully encourage the development of drugs to treat rare diseases and conditions while taking into consideration questions surrounding affordability, profitability, and the meaning of rare use., In its comments to the draft report, FDA expressed concern with the narrow scope of OIG's report, stating that the high-expenditure drugs included in our sample are not representative of the spectrum of orphan-designated drugs and subsequently noting that OIG does not speak to the role that orphan-drug designation plays in drug pricing, or if it plays one at all.  , OIG notes that our current work's focus on high-expenditure Medicare drugs and the resulting limitations of our sample are discussed throughout the report.  Further, OIG agrees that this study is not focused on drug pricing; rather our findings offer insights related to a particular subset of blockbuster drugs, thereby providing descriptive context about their orphan status, associated Medicare expenditures, and the revenue that manufacturers are able to generate.  We believe this approach is generally responsive to Congressional interests in providing appropriate oversight of ODA and will help to support any efforts to ensure that the Orphan Drug Designation Program is best able to meet its vital goals."
599,OEI-03-17-00471,Billions in Estimated Medicare Advantage Payments From Diagnoses Reported Only on Health Risk Assessments Raise Concerns OEI-03-17-00471 09-10-2020,"We undertook this study because of concerns that Medicare Advantage organizations (MAOs) may use health risk assessments (HRAs) to increase risk adjusted payments inappropriately.  The Medicare Advantage (MA) program provided coverage to 23 million beneficiaries in 2019 at a cost of $264 billion.  Unsupported risk adjusted payments have been a major driver of improper payments in the MA program.  CMS risk-adjusts payments by using beneficiaries' diagnoses to pay higher capitated payments to MAOs for sicker beneficiaries, which may create financial incentives for MAOs to make beneficiaries appear as sick as possible.  For CMS to risk adjust payments, MAOs report beneficiaries' diagnoses, based on services provided to beneficiaries, to CMS's MA encounter data system and the Risk Adjustment Processing System.  HRAs are an allowable source of diagnoses for risk adjustment.  An HRA occurs when a physician or other health care professional collects information from beneficiaries about their health to diagnose and identify gaps in care.  However, CMS and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission have raised concerns that MAOs may use HRAs mainly as a tool to collect diagnoses and increase payments to MAOs rather than to improve the health of beneficiaries., We analyzed 2016 MA encounter data to determine the 2017 financial impact of diagnoses reported only on HRAs and not on any other records in the encounter data that year.  We also analyzed CMS's responses to a structured questionnaire to identify actions taken by CMS to review the impact of HRAs on MA payments., Our findings highlight concerns about the extent to which MAOs are using HRAs to improve care, as intended, and about the sufficiency of CMS's oversight.  From our analysis of 2016 MA encounter data, we found that diagnoses that MAOs reported only on HRAs-and on no other service records-resulted in an estimated $2.6 billion in risk-adjusted payments for 2017.  In addition, in-home HRAs generated 80 percent of these estimated payments.  Most in home HRAs were conducted by companies that partner with or are hired by MAOs to conduct these assessments-and therefore are not likely conducted by the beneficiary's own primary care provider.  Twenty MAOs generated millions in payments from in-home HRAs for beneficiaries for whom there was not a single record of any other service being provided in all of 2016.  Our findings raise concerns about the completeness of payment data submitted to CMS, the validity of diagnoses on HRAs, and the quality of care coordination for beneficiaries.  Despite potential issues regarding HRAs, CMS has not yet reviewed the impact of HRAs on risk adjusted payments or quality of care., We recommend that CMS: (1) require MAOs to implement best practices to ensure care coordination for HRAs; (2) provide targeted oversight of the 10 parent organizations that drove most of the risk-adjusted payments resulting from in-home HRAs; (3) provide targeted oversight of the 20 MAOs that drove risk-adjusted payments resulting from in-home HRAs for beneficiaries who had no other service records in the 2016 encounter data; (4) reassess the risks and benefits of allowing in-home HRAs to be used as sources of diagnoses for risk adjustment, and reconsider excluding such diagnoses from risk-adjustment; and (5) require MAOs to flag any MAO initiated HRAs in their MA encounter data.  CMS concurred with our second and third recommendations and disagreed with the others."
600,OEI-05-20-00190,Part D Plans Generally Include Drugs Commonly Used by Dual Eligibles: 2020 OEI-05-20-00190 06-25-2020,"This report fulfills for 2020 the annual reporting mandate from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The ACA requires OIG to conduct a study of the extent to which formularies used by Medicare Part D plans include drugs commonly used by full benefit dual eligible individuals (i.e., individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits).  These individuals generally get drug coverage through Medicare Part D.  Pursuant to the ACA, OIG must annually issue a report with recommendations as appropriate.  This is the tenth report that OIG has produced to meet this mandate. , For this report, we determined whether the 448 unique formularies used by the 4,610 Part D plans operating in 2020 cover the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles.  We also determined the extent to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools to those commonly used drugs.  To create the list of the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles, we used the 2017 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey-the most recent data available at the time of our study.  Of the top 200 drugs, 195 are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage, 2 are excluded from coverage, 1 is no longer offered as a prescription, and 1 is a medical supply item covered by Part D.  One additional drug is eligible for Part D coverage, but we did not include it in our analysis because we could not confidently project the use of this drug to the entire dual-eligible population., Overall, we found that the rate of Part D plan formularies' inclusion of the 195 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles is high, with some variation.  On average, Part D plan formularies include 97 percent of the 195 commonly used drugs.  In addition, 75 percent of the commonly used drugs are included by all Part D plan formularies.  These results are largely unchanged from OIG's findings in our mandated annual report from 2019, as well as from the findings in our reports from 2011 through 2018., We also found that the percentage of drugs to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools increased slightly between 2019 and 2020.  On average, formularies applied utilization management tools to 29 percent of the unique drugs we reviewed in 2020, an increase of 1 percentage point from 2019., Inclusion rates for the 195 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles are largely unchanged from the inclusion rates listed in our previous reports.  Part D formularies include roughly the same high percentage of these commonly used drugs in 2020 as they did in 2019.  As mandated by the ACA, OIG will continue to monitor and produce annual reports on the extent to which Part D plan formularies cover drugs that dual eligibles commonly use.  In addition, OIG will continue to monitor Part D plan formularies' application of utilization management tools to these drugs.  OIG has no recommendations at this time."

603,OEI-02-20-00150,2019 Performance Data for the Senior Medicare Patrol Projects OEI-02-20-00150 06-30-2020,"This memorandum report presents performance data for the Senior Medicare Patrol
(SMP) projects, which receive grants from ACL to recruit and train retired professionals and other older adults and community members to recognize and report instances or patterns of health care fraud.  OIG has collected these performance data since 1997., We based our review on data reported by 54 SMP projects for 7 performance measures pertaining to recoveries, savings, and cost avoidance and 5 performance measures relating to SMP activities.  For the first group of measures, we reviewed supporting documentation for the data.  For the second group, we reviewed the data for any discrepancies (e.g., if a project reported holding no events but reported a number of people who attended events)., In 2019, the 54 SMP projects had a total of 6,875 active team members who conducted a total of 28,146 group outreach and education events, reaching an estimated 1.6 million people.  In addition, the projects had 320,590 individual interactions with, or on behalf of, a Medicare beneficiary., For 2019, the SMP projects reported $2.4 million in expected Medicare recoveries.  Almost all of these recoveries came from one project that uncovered a fraud scheme that encouraged low-income senior citizens to submit DNA samples for medically unnecessary genetic testing.  Three defendants were sentenced and ordered to pay a total of $2.3 million in restitution and forfeitures.  In addition, cost avoidance totaled $60,971, while savings to beneficiaries and others totaled $20,150.  , In comparison to 2018, the projects reported a 15-percent increase in the number of individual interactions in 2019 (320,590, up from 278,761).  The number of group outreach and education events increased slightly by 5 percent, but the number of people reached through these channels decreased by about the same percentage (1.6 million, down from 1.7 million).  In addition, the projects reported significantly higher amounts for Medicare recoveries ($2.4 million, up from $15,136), while cost avoidance dropped ($60,971, down from $602,063). , We note that the projects may not be receiving full credit for recoveries, savings, and cost avoidance attributable to their work.  It is not always possible to track referrals to Medicare contractors or law enforcement from beneficiaries who have learned to detect fraud, waste, and abuse from the projects.  In addition, the projects are unable to track the potentially substantial savings derived from a sentinel effect, whereby Medicare beneficiaries' scrutiny of their bills reduces fraud and errors. "
604,OEI-01-20-00220,Medicare Lacks Consistent Oversight of Cybersecurity for Networked Medical Devices in Hospitals,"Without proper cybersecurity controls, hospitals' networked medical devices (i.e., devices designed to connect to the internet, hospital networks, and other medical devices) can be compromised, which can lead to patient harm.  CMS's survey protocol for overseeing hospitals is silent with respect to the cybersecurity of these devices.  This evaluation sheds new light on the extent to which Medicare accreditation organizations (AOs) use their discretion to address cybersecurity of networked devices during hospital surveys.  As hospitals continue to be targeted in cyberattacks that risk patient harm, it is important to know whether and how AOs evaluate and hold hospitals accountable for cybersecurity of their devices., We conducted structured telephone interviews with leadership at the four AOs and sent written questions to CMS.  We asked AOs about the extent to which their survey standards required hospitals to have a cybersecurity plan for networked devices as well as other ways in which their surveys might cover cybersecurity for networked devices.  We also reviewed documentation of relevant survey standards and procedures from the AOs. , CMS's survey protocol does not include requirements for networked device cybersecurity, and the AOs do not use their discretion to require hospitals to have such cybersecurity plans.  However, AOs sometimes review limited aspects of device cybersecurity.  For example, two AOs have equipment-maintenance requirements that may yield limited insight into device cybersecurity.  If hospitals identify networked device cybersecurity as part of their emergency preparedness risk assessments, AOs will review the hospitals' mitigation plans.  AOs told us that in practice, however, hospitals did not identify device cybersecurity in these risk assessments very often.  Assessing hospital safeguards for the privacy of medical records may prompt AOs to examine networked devices.  Finally, CMS and the AOs do not plan to update their survey requirements to address networked devices or general cybersecurity., As health care delivery becomes more reliant on technology, cyberattacks on hospitals are increasing.  Yet CMS's requirements are silent on networked device cybersecurity as well as cybersecurity in general.  As a result, Medicare lacks consistent oversight of networked device cybersecurity in hospitals.  Therefore, we recommend that CMS identify and implement an appropriate way to address cybersecurity of networked medical devices in its quality oversight of hospitals, in consultation with Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) partners and others.  CMS stated that it concurred with considering additional ways to appropriately highlight the importance of cybersecurity of networked medical devices for providers in consultation with its HHS partners that have specific oversight authority regarding cybersecurity.  We look forward to CMS's sharing, in its Final Management Decision, its plan for addressing cybersecurity of networked medical devices under its own authority for quality oversight of hospitals."

This is not a review of HHS response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have collected this information as an aid for HHS as it continues to lead efforts to address the public health emergency and support hospitals and other first responders.  In addition, hospitals may find the information about each other's strategies useful in their efforts to mitigate the challenges they are facing., The hospital input that we describe reflects their experiences and perspectives at a point in time-March 23-27, 2020.  The pandemic is fast-moving, as are the efforts to address it.  We recognize that HHS, Congress, and other Federal, State, local, and Tribal government entities are taking substantial actions on a continual basis to support hospitals in responding to COVID-19.  HHS has already taken and continues to take actions related to each of the challenges that hospitals identified in our survey, and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provides the basis for additional actions.  We present this information for HHS and other decision-makers' consideration as they continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic., This report is based on brief telephone interviews (""pulse surveys"") conducted  March 23-27, 2020, with hospital administrators from 323 hospitals across 46 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, that were part of our random sample.  Our rate of contact was 85 percent. , Interviews focused on three key questions: , Hospitals reported that their most significant challenges centered on testing and caring for patients with COVID-19 and keeping staff safe.  Hospitals said that severe shortages of testing supplies and extended waits for test results limited hospitals' ability to monitor the health of patients and staff.  They also reported that widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) put staff and patients at risk.  In addition, hospitals said that they were not always able to maintain adequate staffing levels or to offer staff adequate support., Hospitals also described substantial challenges maintaining and expanding capacity to care for patients.  Capacity concerns emerged as hospitals anticipated being overwhelmed if they experience a surge of patients, who would need specialty beds and isolated areas for effective treatment.  Hospitals explained that shortages of critical supplies, materials, and logistic support that accompany more beds affected hospitals' ability to care for patients.  Hospitals also cited anticipated shortages of ventilators as a potential challenge.  Hospitals described increasing costs and decreasing revenues as a threat to their financial viability.  Further, hospitals reported that changing and sometimes inconsistent guidance from Federal, State, and local authorities posed challenges and confused hospitals and the public., Hospitals reported using a range of strategies to maintain or expand their capacity to care for patients and to keep staff safe.  To secure the necessary PPE, equipment (including ventilators), and supplies for their staff, hospital administrators reported turning to new, sometimes un-vetted, and non-traditional sources of supplies and medical equipment.  To ensure adequate staffing to treat patients with COVID-19, hospitals were training medical staff like anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and nursing staff to help care for patients on ventilators.  To support staff, some hospitals reported providing services such as childcare, laundry, grocery services, and hotel accommodations that promote separation from elderly family members.  To manage patient flow and hospital capacity, some hospitals were providing ambulatory care for patients with less severe symptoms, telehealth services when possible, and setting up alternate facilities such as fairgrounds, and non-operating college dorms and closed correctional facilities as additional space for patient care., At the time of our interviews (March 23-27, 2020), hospitals reported pressing needs for government assistance to help meet COVID-19 response challenges.  Broadly, the actions they described fall into five categories: 1) assistance with testing, supplies, and equipment (e.g., PPE); 2) assistance with workforce allocation; 3) assistance with capacity of facilities; 4) financial assistance; and 5) communication and public information.  , We recognize that HHS has taken and continues to take actions toward these hospital challenges and needs.  Our report presents hospital suggestions on ways that the government could assist them for HHS's and other decision-makers' consideration as they continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic."

Title IV provided $5 million for the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), to conduct oversight of the UAC Program.  On January 31, 2020, in response to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, the Secretary of HHS declared a public health emergency.  Following this declaration, Congress appropriated $12 million to HHS-OIG to conduct oversight of HHS's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  , Previous HHS-OIG work has focused on the Office of Refugee Resettlement's (ORR's) efforts to ensure the health and safety of children in the UAC Program, including when the UAC Program experiences a sudden change in the number or needs of children.  This report builds on our oversight of ORR's efforts to protect children and is one of two reports addressing emergency preparedness at ORR facilities.  This report specifically addresses communicable disease preparedness., Our objective was to determine whether ORR ensured that selected care provider facilities (facilities) followed ORR requirements in preparing for and responding to communicable diseases, such as COVID-19., We conducted this communicable disease preparedness audit of 11 selected facilities from March through June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  Because most States were under stay-at-home orders, we sent questionnaires to the 11 selected care providers and requested documentation from each.  We also interviewed ORR regarding its oversight responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic., ORR ensured that the 11 facilities we selected for review followed ORR requirements in preparing for and responding to communicable diseases and were prepared to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, ORR provided detailed COVID-19-response guidance, encouraged telehealth visits, and updated the UAC Portal., The 11 selected facilities that we reviewed were generally prepared to respond to an emergency event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in accordance with Federal guidance.  Specifically, they had policies and procedures, the capability to quarantine COVID-19 cases in their facilities, and adequate personal protective equipment.  , ORR officials stated that, since 2006, ORR has had a policy in place that required its facilities to prepare for and respond to a communicable disease outbreak; therefore, the facilities were generally able to quickly pivot to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. , This report contains no recommendations., In response to our draft report, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) stated that ORR's standard operating procedures for communicable diseases follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) surveillance and outbreak guidelines for each specific disease.  ACF also stated that ORR will continue to monitor the situation around COVID-19 and coordinate all response efforts with CDC and local public health officials.

OIG therefore developed a plan to assess the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) controls related to hospital preparedness for emerging infectious diseases., The objective of this audit was to determine whether CMS designed and implemented effective internal controls related to hospital preparedness for emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19., We reviewed the design and implementation of CMS's controls regarding the approximately 500 hospitals certified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid by State survey agencies under contract with CMS.  We also reviewed CMS's controls regarding the approximately 4,200 hospitals known as accredited hospitals because they have joined a CMS-approved program operated by a private accreditation organization., We limited the scope of our audit to the design and implementation of CMS's controls., CMS's controls were well-designed and implemented, but CMS's authority is not sufficient for it to fulfill its responsibility to ensure that accredited hospitals would maintain quality and safety during an emerging infectious disease emergency.  Specifically, although CMS announced in February 2019 that it was critical for all hospitals to plan for emerging infectious diseases, CMS could not determine that all accredited hospitals updated their emergency preparedness plans to include this planning until 2022 due to accreditation organizations' quality and safety inspection cycles.  Further, when COVID-19 emerged in the United States, CMS requested (but could not require) accreditation organizations to perform special targeted infection control surveys to help accredited hospitals prepare for COVID-19 patients.  Accreditation organizations performed no such special surveys and, as of August 17, 2020, State survey agencies only performed these surveys at about 13 percent of accredited hospitals and had not performed any in 13 States because of CMS's limited authority over accredited hospitals.  As a result of these limitations, CMS could not ensure that accredited hospitals would continue to provide quality care and operate safely during the COVID 19 emergency, and cannot ensure quality and safety at accredited hospitals when a future emerging infectious disease threatens the United States., We recommend that CMS make regulatory changes to allow it to require accreditation organizations to perform special surveys after it issues new participation requirements or guidance and during a public health emergency to address the risks presented by the emergency.  In written comments on our draft report, CMS concurred with our recommendation.  CMS also indicated that, in March 2021, it updated its State Operations Manual to include additional planning considerations and preparedness guidance that expanded on emerging infectious diseases.  , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
613,A-07-20-06092,National Snapshot of State Agency Approaches to Child Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic A-07-20-06092 09-29-2020,"Federal law requires agencies of State government to prepare for disasters, including the need to provide for the continuity of child care.  The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) program provides subsidized child care services to low-income families, families receiving temporary public assistance, and families transitioning from public assistance so that family members can work or attend training or education.  This audit provides a national snapshot of State-level approaches to some of the issues posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in child care settings.  Our objective was to identify the approaches that CCDF lead agencies in each State and the District of Columbia (State agencies) adopted to ensure access to safe child care as well as to protect the providers rendering that care in their CCDF programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic., Our findings are based on responses to a questionnaire and followup interviews that we conducted with State agencies between April 30 and June 16, 2020, with an as-of date of April 30, 2020, which focused on closures of child care facilities as well as stay-at-home or shelter-in-place directives, issuance of guidance to providers on protective measures, State agencies' disaster plans, use of CCDF flexibilities to lessen the impact of COVID-19, waiver requests, and the most significant challenges and concerns that State agencies identified., In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, State agencies have adopted various approaches to ensure access to safe child care as well as to protect the providers rendering that care in their CCDF programs., Nationally, State agencies reported that about 63 percent of child care centers and 27 percent of family child care providers (collectively, child care facilities) had closed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Eight States reported that more than 75 percent of their child care facilities had closed.  Twenty other States reported that between 50 and 75 percent of these facilities had closed., All of the State agencies reported that they issued guidance to child care providers on protective measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and although almost all of the State agencies said that they were following the provisions of their disaster plans, 26 State agencies said that they revised or intended to revise those plans.  Many State agencies used the flexibilities afforded to them by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), the cognizant Federal agency, to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on child care providers and to ensure continued access to child care.  To implement changes to their CCDF programs, many State agencies sought changes in their State requirements, requested waivers from ACF, and submitted CCDF plan amendments., The most frequently identified challenges, according to State agencies, were communication with stakeholders, difficulties with fingerprinting for prospective child care employees' background checks, insufficient funding for providers, health and safety considerations on the part of child care staff members, and the lack of and inability to secure personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies.  The State agencies' most frequently identified concerns once the pandemic has abated were the need to ensure that there would be enough providers to meet child care needs, the need for funding to stabilize the industry, and the need to hire and retain staff.  , The information in this report was current when we conducted our questionnaire and interviews but may not represent all of the issues that ACF and State agencies have faced or the actions they have taken to address those issues.  This report makes no recommendations.  It is intended that ACF use this report to support State agencies as they work to address ongoing issues that could impede access to child care as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Because we make no recommendations, ACF did not provide written comments on our draft report, but it did provide technical comments, which we addressed as appropriate., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

615,OEI-04-19-00570,"HHS's Suspension and Debarment Program Helped Safeguard Federal Funding, But Opportunities for Improvement Exist OEI-04-19-00570 01-24-2022","As the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the largest Federal grant-making agency ($531 billion in 2019) and the fourth-largest Federal contracting agency ($39 billion in 2019), it is important for it to have a robust suspension and debarment program.  (Suspensions are preliminary, immediate actions that exclude persons from receiving new funds.  Debarments are final determinations that exclude persons from receiving new funds for a specified time.)  If bad actors or poor performers are not prevented from receiving additional Federal awards in a timely manner, beneficiaries of public health and human services programs may suffer and taxpayer funds may be misused.  , We analyzed multiple data sources to describe the outcomes, sources, and timeliness of suspension and debarment referrals during our review period, fiscal years 2015 through 2019.  We also identified factors that may have affected the timeliness, efficiency, and effectiveness of HHS's suspension and debarment program.  For example, we reviewed referral data and surveyed awarding agencies and non-awarding entities.  (Awarding agencies award HHS funds-e.g., grants and contracts.  Non-awarding entities within HHS do not fund awards, but often have oversight responsibilities.  Referrals for suspension or debarment are made by awarding agencies and non-awarding entities if they suspect awardee misconduct.)  We also interviewed the Office of Recipient Integrity Coordination (ORIC), which receives referrals and manages the HHS suspension and debarment program, and HHS's suspension and debarment official (SDO), who determines if any suspension or debarment action should be implemented. , Between FYs 2015 and 2019, 86 percent of referrals that HHS entities made to ORIC resulted in suspension, debarment, or other administrative action to protect Federal programs and funds.  Nearly one-third of debarments involving grants had preceding suspensions.  ORIC does not have complete guidance about the circumstances in which immediate action (i.e., suspension) may be appropriate while awaiting a debarment.  Most of the referrals for suspension or debarment came from HHS non-awarding entities, while many HHS awarding agencies made no referrals during the 5 year period we reviewed.  Suspension and debarment actions often missed ORIC's internal timeliness goals.  Delays resulted in part from ongoing criminal or appeals proceedings and challenges in obtaining necessary information about the person referred for suspension or debarment.  Other factors that affected the timeliness, efficiency, and effectiveness of this program were (1) vacancies and turnover at both the staff and senior leadership levels; (2) a limited system for case management and tracking of referrals; and (3) incomplete guidance regarding the use and documentation of corrective actions for fact-based referrals (as distinguished from conviction-based referrals).  , To improve the timeliness, efficiency, and effectiveness of HHS's suspension and debarment program, we recommend that ASFR (1) take steps to ensure that the program has more consistent senior leadership and sufficient staffing; (2) improve the case management and tracking of referrals; (3) develop and disseminate guidance regarding how to prepare and submit complete referrals; and (4) conduct outreach and provide additional training to HHS awarding agencies that make few or no referrals.  ASFR concurred with all four of our recommendations. "
616,OEI-02-20-00320,"Opioid Use in Medicare Part D Continued To Decline in 2019, but Vigilance Is Needed as COVID-19 Raises New Concerns OEI-02-20-00320 08-13-2020","The United States has been grappling with the opioid crisis for several years.  In 2018, nearly 47,000 opioid-related overdose deaths occurred in the United States.  OIG has been tracking opioid use in Medicare Part D since 2016.  In particular, OIG has identified beneficiaries at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose and prescribers with questionable opioid prescribing for these beneficiaries. , This data brief provides important information on opioid use in Medicare Part D in 2019, before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  This information is critical to understanding trends in opioid use.  This data brief will also provide comparison points for a forthcoming OIG data brief, which will examine changes in opioid use that occurred during the pandemic in 2020., As of 2019, opioid use in Part D had decreased and the use of MAT drugs and the availability of naloxone had increased.  Together, these changes show progress from the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services—and others—to address the opioid crisis.  Nonetheless, it is critical to remain vigilant.  The current COVID-19 pandemic makes the need to look at this population even more pressing.  Early reports for 2020 indicate that overdose deaths are rising in some areas of the country.  The National Institute on Drug Abuse—part of the National Institutes of Health—warned that individuals with opioid use disorder could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19 as it is a disease that attacks the lungs, and respiratory disease is known to increase the risk of fatal overdose among people taking opioids.  In addition, a number of rules related to telehealth and the prescribing of opioids have been relaxed in response to COVID-19 to ensure greater access to legitimate prescribing during the pandemic.  These changes may unintentionally increase the risk of doctor shopping and inappropriate opioid prescribing in 2020.   Ensuring the appropriate use and prescribing of opioids is essential to protecting the health and safety of beneficiaries and the integrity of Part D.  OIG is committed to continuing our work on opioid use and access to treatment in 2020 and beyond.  Likewise, we encourage CMS to also closely monitor opioid use and access to treatment in 2020 and beyond.  "
617,OEI-07-19-00372,Case Study: Missouri's Efforts To Protect Children Missing From Foster Care OEI-07-19-00372 09-28-2021,"On any given day, thousands of children nationwide are missing from their foster care placements.  Children who go missing from foster care often experience adverse outcomes.  In 2019, 978 children went missing at some point from foster care in Missouri.  In August of that year, OIG agents joined the Department of Justice and local law enforcement in Missouri metropolitan areas to locate children who were missing from foster care.  OIG agents shared concerns that prompted this evaluation.  ACF provides Federal funding and oversight to States and eligible Tribes to support foster care programs., To follow up on OIG agents' concerns, we evaluated whether the Missouri foster care agency (Missouri) followed applicable Federal and State laws, policies, and procedures to protect the 59 children whose cases we included in our review.  We determined whether Missouri provided these children with required services before and after their episodes of being missing, and whether the State followed requirements when the children went missing.  Additionally, we evaluated whether children were identified as having any characteristics commonly associated with a higher risk of going missing from care.  This case study is not projectable to the entire population of children who went missing; however, it uses insights gained from OIG involvement in the joint law enforcement task force that point to high-risk areas for further review., Though Missouri is not required to do so, we note that it does not have policies for identifying children who may be at heightened risk of going missing or interventions to reduce their risk.  In the 59 cases we reviewed in detail, Missouri rarely demonstrated attempts to reduce children's risk of going missing.  The majority of the children who went missing (49 of the 59 children) had risk factors associated with a higher risk of going missing.  Missouri rarely provided these children with services to reduce their risk of going missing from care—only 7 of the 49 case files indicated that children received such services., During the times in which children were missing from care, Missouri frequently failed to comply with requirements that could have aided in locating them.  Nearly half of the case files contained no evidence of Missouri reporting the children as missing, as required, to either local law enforcement or the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  Additionally, for many missing children, there was no evidence that Missouri made the required notifications and contacts to seek information on the children's potential whereabouts., For one in three of the children whose cases we reviewed, there was no documentation that the child received any required health and safety checks following the child's return to foster care.  For these children, there was no evidence that their case managers assessed their safety, determined their experiences while missing, or determined whether they fell victim to sex trafficking while they were missing from care., In our conversations with Missouri officials, we learned that Missouri cannot rely on its case management system to accurately identify children who are missing from foster care without reviewing individual case files.  The current system alone cannot distinguish between children who are missing from their placement and those who are in an unapproved, but known, placement., To better protect children from the risks associated with being missing from foster care, we recommend that Missouri (1) develop policies to help identify (a) children who have a heightened risk of going missing from care and (b) interventions that could reduce their risk; (2) implement a monitoring mechanism to ensure that case managers comply with requirements and document their compliance when children are identified as missing and when they are located or return to care; and (3) implement improvements to the case management system to enable accurate identification of children who are missing from foster care.  , Thousands of children are missing from foster care systems across the Nation, and—given the critical role States must play in protecting these children—States need additional support and guidance from the national level.  Therefore, we recommend that ACF (1) develop a forum for States to share experiences and best practices related to reducing children's risk for going missing from foster care, locating missing children, and addressing their needs after they return to care; and (2) support Missouri as it works to reduce children's risk for going missing from foster care and improve compliance with Federal and State requirements related to children who go missing. , Missouri did not explicitly concur or nonconcur with our three recommendations to its agency, but it did note actions it has taken in response to our recommendations and agreed to take additional responsive actions.  ACF concurred with our two recommendations to its agency."
618,OEI-03-20-00230,"Nationwide, Almost All Medicaid Managed Care Plans Achieved Their Medical Loss Ratio Targets OEI-03-20-00230 08-06-2021","Managed care has replaced fee-for-service as the predominant payment model in Medicaid.  State and Federal spending on Medicaid managed care is growing and totaled $360 billion in 2020, accounting for more than half of total Medicaid spending that year.  Federal requirements for medical loss ratios (MLRs) were established to ensure that Medicaid managed care plans spend most of their revenue on health care services and quality improvements, thereby limiting the amount that plans can spend on administration and keep as profit.  An MLR is the percentage of revenue that a managed care plan spends on services related to the health of its enrollees.  MLR requirements also enhance fiscal stewardship of Medicaid expenditures by helping to ensure that States have sufficient information to oversee spending by their Medicaid managed care plans., Federal regulations give States the option to choose to establish a minimum MLR of at least 85 percent for their Medicaid managed care plans.  Regardless of whether a State establishes a minimum MLR, it must use plan reported MLR data to set future payment rates for managed care so that its plans will ""reasonably achieve"" an MLR of at least 85 percent., This data brief provides stakeholders with national data on (1) the MLRs of Medicaid managed care plans and (2) the extent to which plans met State-set minimum MLRs and the Federal MLR standard of 85 percent., We requested that Medicaid agencies from th 50 States and the District of Columbia (which we refer to collectively as States) complete an online survey and submit information about their managed care plans that are subject to Federal MLR requirements.  We also requested that States provide the annual MLR reports that they received from their Medicaid managed care plans.  All 51 States responded to our information request, and 43 States had plans that were subject to Federal MLR requirements as of September 1, 2020.  States submitted annual MLR reports for reporting periods ending in 2017, 2018, or 2019.  We analyzed States' survey responses and annual MLR reports for 513 plans to identify States' MLR requirements and the extent to which plans had met State-set minimum MLRs and the Federal 85 percent standard., Although Federal MLR regulations do not require States to set minimum MLRs, 34 States had established minimum MLRs for 434 Medicaid managed care plans for annual reporting periods ending in 2017, 2018, or 2019.  Ninety-one percent of plans met these State-set minimum MLRs.  However, 39 plans failed to meet their State-set minimum MLRs for the period reviewed.  Nineteen of these plans reported owing a total of $198 million to States that had opted to require their plans to return money to the State when minimum MLRs were not met. For all but one plan, the owed amount covered a 12 month MLR reporting period.  Finally, 92 percent of Medicaid managed care plans (471 of 513) achieved MLRs that met or exceeded the Federal 85 percent MLR standard regardless of whether their States had established minimum MLR requirements.  , This data brief shows that nationwide, almost all managed care plans met or exceeded MLR requirements to direct funds toward patient care and quality improvements.  Further, it demonstrates that States that choose to establish minimum MLRs with requirements to return monies may recoup millions of Medicaid dollars from plans that fail to meet the State-set minimum MLRs.  In a separate forthcoming report, OIG will (1) evaluate States' oversight of their Medicaid managed care plans' compliance with MLR reporting requirements and (2) assess the completeness of MLR data that plans have reported to the States."

Children exposed to lead may suffer stunted cognitive development and delayed reproductive development.  In the longer term, elevated blood lead levels have been linked to increased incidence of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as well as higher rates of violent crime and arrests in adulthood.  Prevention is key to avoiding the permanent developmental effects of lead exposure on children.  Scheduled blood lead screening tests can support early detection of elevated blood lead levels, timely followup, and improved outcomes for children. , We selected five States for which we reviewed Medicaid claims data and supplemental health department data for fiscal years (FYs) 2015-18.  We examined the extent to which Medicaid enrolled children received required blood lead screening tests.  We also interviewed stakeholders and surveyed practitioners to identify challenges in providing blood lead screening tests, followup services, and treatment for Medicaid-enrolled children., Many Medicaid-enrolled children in five States did not receive required blood lead screening tests on schedule during FYs 2015-18.  Specifically, more than one third of the 1 million children who were required to receive a 12-month and a 24-month blood lead screening test received neither test.  Additionally, of the approximately 209,000 children who had been continuously enrolled in Medicaid from birth through age 3, 1 in 5 children in the selected States had never received a blood lead screening test by 3 years of age.  Finally, stakeholders we interviewed called for consistent requirements for blood lead screening tests and practitioners reported challenges with providing blood lead screening tests for Medicaid-enrolled children., To address challenges that contribute to low participation rates in the blood lead testing component of the EPSDT benefit, we recommend that CMS: (1) monitor national EPSDT performance data for blood lead screening tests and target efforts toward low-performing States to develop action plans for increasing the provision of blood lead screening tests according to Medicaid's schedule; (2) ensure consistency across CMS guidance related to actionable blood lead reference values and blood lead screening test definitions; and (3) coordinate with partners to develop and disseminate to State Medicaid agencies educational resources that reaffirm requirements and schedules for blood lead screening tests.  CMS concurred with our recommendations."
622,OEI-06-19-00331,"Indian Health Service Facilities Made Progress Incorporating Patient Protection Policies, but Challenges Remain OEI-06-19-00331 12-17-2020","In recent years, IHS had cases of health care providers abusing patients under facility care.  In February 2019, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs both requested that OIG review IHS policies for preventing, reporting, and addressing patient abuse in IHS facilities.  In December 2019, OIG issued a report that found that IHS had strengthened its policies to protect children from sexual abuse by providers.  Yet, we found gaps in IHS policies, such as not covering different types of abuse and circumstances, and some IHS facilities had not implemented the new agencywide policies.  This study expands on that report, assessing facility implementation of the policies and identifying potential challenges to their effectiveness., We based our findings on survey responses from 97 IHS-operated health care facilities, including hospitals, health centers, and health stations, and onsite interviews with leadership and staff at 16 of these facilities.  We collected our data during February-March 2020.  Topics for the survey and interviews included implementation of IHS patient protection policies and related challenges, training needs, communication and collaboration with IHS headquarters and Area Offices, and barriers to patient abuse reporting and improvement efforts., Most IHS facilities (81 of 97) reported that they fully incorporated the agencywide patient protection policies, aimed at preventing and addressing child sexual abuse by health care providers, into their local policies and procedures, but some facilities are still early in implementation.  All facilities reported that staff completed mandatory training on the new policies.  Many facilities supplemented the training and expressed need for further training to support staff understanding of reporting requirements.  We found that nearly two-thirds of facilities (62 of 97) reported encountering challenges in carrying out the policies.  The most common challenges were providing chaperones during medical exams, due to staffing shortages and delays in background investigations; ensuring anonymity of victims and reporters; coordinating with law enforcement; and understanding the policies.  All facilities said that they were generally confident that staff would report suspected patient abuse, but most (88 of 97) noted existing barriers that may deter staff and patients from reporting.  We found that IHS has established avenues for reporting patient abuse and taken steps to promote an organizational culture of transparency, but the facilities reported remaining barriers, including fear of retaliation, stigma related to sexual abuse, and lack of awareness on what and how to report, among others.  We identified some of the same barriers in our 2019 report. , To address the issues identified in this report and further protect patients from abuse, we recommend that IHS: (1) provide additional guidance and training to facilities on patient protection policies, including the role of law enforcement and the reporting process related to patient abuse; (2) improve the process and timeliness for conducting staff background investigations and notifying facilities when staff are approved; (3) examine and revise, as needed, the reporting structure in the policies and the incident reporting system to ensure that staff and patients can report anonymously; and (4) establish and enforce a deadline by which all facilities must fully incorporate the new requirements into their policies and procedures, and actively monitor facility adherence.  IHS concurred with our recommendations."
623,OEI-07-19-00490,CMS Could Improve the Data It Uses To Monitor Antipsychotic Drugs in Nursing Homes,"CMS has oversight of Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes that are responsible for the health and safety of vulnerable residents.  CMS is required to monitor nursing home activities, including how nursing homes use antipsychotic drugs to treat residents' various conditions.  These drugs can be effective in treating a range of conditions, but they carry risk and must be prescribed appropriately.  CMS uses the Minimum Data Set (MDS)—i.e., data that nursing homes self-report—as its sole data source to count the number of nursing home residents receiving antipsychotic drugs.  CMS has acknowledged the risk for inappropriate use of antipsychotic drugs.  CMS has taken important steps to reduce the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes and could further that progress by collecting more complete data on residents' use of these drugs., Nursing home residents and their families rely on nursing homes to provide quality care in a safe environment; however, there are reasons for concern specific to the use of antipsychotic drugs.  Previous OIG work in 2011 raised quality and safety concerns regarding the high use of antipsychotic medications among nursing home residents.  Since then, CMS has taken important steps to monitor the use of these drugs in nursing homes.  However, CMS has acknowledged the potential for inconsistencies in the data—self-reported by nursing homes—that it uses to monitor quality and the safe use of antipsychotic drugs., We compared Medicare claims to MDS records for nursing home residents age 65 and older in 2018.  The claims data include prescription drug event records for Part D drugs; Medicare Part A and B claims data from the National Claims History File; and Part C encounter data.  We determined the number of residents who had a Part D claim for an antipsychotic drug as compared to the number of residents whom the MDS reported as receiving these drugs.  These analyses are not comparable to the CMS quality measure.  Further, we determined the extent to which there were inconsistencies between residents' MDS-reported diagnoses of schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, or Tourette's syndrome-three diagnoses that exclude residents from CMS's quality measure regarding antipsychotics-and these residents' Medicare claims in 2017 and 2018 for each respective diagnosis., We found that CMS's use of the MDS as the sole data source to count the number of nursing home residents using antipsychotic drugs may not always provide complete information.  This means some residents' use of antipsychotics may not have been detected by CMS's quality measure intended to monitor these drugs.  By analyzing a separate data source—Medicare claims—we found that using the MDS did not always result in a complete assessment of the number of residents who are prescribed antipsychotic drugs.  Specifically, in 2018, 12,091 Part D beneficiaries who were long-stay residents age 65 and older—5 percent of all such beneficiaries—had a Part D claim for an antipsychotic drug but were not reported in the MDS as receiving an antipsychotic drug.  Further, nearly one-third of residents who were reported in the MDS as having schizophrenia—a diagnosis that excludes them from CMS's measure of antipsychotic drug use—did not have any Medicare service claims for that diagnosis.  Finally, even for those residents included in the MDS counts, the MDS does not provide important details about the drug use (e.g., which antipsychotic drugs were prescribed; at what quantities and strengths; and for what durations)., These findings suggest that CMS could enhance the information it uses to monitor antipsychotics in nursing homes by using additional data sources in its measurement of this complex issue that is critical for resident health and safety.  , So that CMS can enhance the information it uses to monitor antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes, we recommend that CMS (1) take additional steps to validate the information reported in MDS assessments and (2) supplement the data it uses to monitor the use of antipsychotic drugs in nursing homes.  CMS concurred with both recommendations."
624,OEI-01-20-00430,"Onsite Surveys of Nursing Homes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: March 23-May 30, 2020 OEI-01-20-00430 12-17-2020","2021 Addendum: <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-01-20-00431.asp"">States' Backlogs of Standard Surveys of Nursing Homes Grew Substantially During the COVID-19 Pandemic</a>, We did this review to determine the number and results of onsite State surveys of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as COVID-19, and infection control has been a persistent problem for most nursing homes.  As of November 8, 2020, more than 67,000 nursing home residents had died of COVID-19-related illnesses, which represented almost 30 percent of all COVID 19 deaths in the United States at that time.  Onsite State surveys assess the quality of services in nursing homes, a critical function for protecting residents.  CMS changed survey practices in response to the pandemic.  These changes—together with nursing home residents' high-risk status and the importance of the State surveys—warrant close examination to assess the sufficiency of this oversight., We analyzed CMS administrative data to determine the number of focused infection control and complaint surveys conducted during March 23-May 30, 2020.  We also identified the number and types of deficiencies cited as a result of these surveys.  We interviewed officials in CMS and 10 States to learn more about their approaches to oversight, challenges to conducting onsite surveys, and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic., States conducted onsite surveys at 31 percent of nursing homes during March 23-May 30, 2020; however, States varied significantly.  During the same time period in 2019—when States and CMS were under normal operations and conducting standard and other surveys—53 percent of nursing homes received an onsite survey.  The infection control surveys conducted during this timeframe in 2020 resulted in few deficiencies, in part because of their limited scope and less surveyor time onsite.  State officials reported ongoing challenges to securing adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and surveyors to complete onsite surveys.  States provided guidance and other support—such as training—to nursing homes outside of the survey process.  State officials reported concerns about mounting backlogs of standard and complaint surveys, as the pandemic continues., We recommend that CMS assess the results of the focused infection control survey and revise the survey as appropriate.  We also recommend that CMS work with States to help overcome challenges with PPE and staffing, and that it clarify expectations for States to complete backlogs of surveys.  CMS did not explicitly concur with our recommendations to assess and revise the infection control survey or to clarify expectations for States to complete backlogs, but stated it has taken steps to implement those recommendations.  CMS did not concur with our recommendation to work with States to overcome challenges with PPE and staffing, citing its lack of authority to address issues of allocating PPE and staff.  OIG continues to recommend that CMS identify opportunities within its authority to support States facing challenges with PPE and staffing.   "

However, data on the number of nursing home residents who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or likely COVID-19 have not been readily available, particularly for early in the pandemic.  Nursing homes are not required to report cases and deaths that occurred before May 8, 2020. , This data snapshot provides objective, standardized data based on Medicare claims for all Medicare beneficiaries in nursing homes throughout the country.  This data snapshot is the first in a three-part series.  Subsequent work will address the characteristics of the hardest hit nursing homes and strategies used by nursing homes to confront the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic., The toll that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on Medicare beneficiaries in nursing homes demonstrates the need for increased action to mitigate the effects of the ongoing pandemic and to avert such tragedies from occurring in the future.  OIG is committed to understanding and helping to protect nursing home residents from the impacts of COVID-19.  We recognize that CMS is also committed to protecting nursing home residents.  Additional data analysis, particularly on Medicare claims data, may help CMS in its efforts.  Medicare claims data include demographic information about each beneficiary as well as information about the beneficiary's conditions and care needs.  These data are important to understanding the effects of the pandemic and, moving forward, could play an integral part in understanding health disparities within the nursing home population and preparing for and dealing with future public health crises.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the opioid crisis because individuals with an opioid use disorder may be at a higher risk for COVID-19 infection and serious consequences from that disease.  In response to the pandemic, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) granted opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and States increased flexibilities to ensure the delivery of OTP services and to protect patients and staff from COVID-19 to the greatest extent possible.  To obtain information on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on OTPs, we conducted interviews with 142 OTPs., Our objectives were to identify: (1) challenges that OTPs have encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) actions that OTPs have taken to address those challenges while ensuring the continuity of needed services and protecting the health and safety of their patients and staff., Of 1,746 OTPs nationwide, we randomly selected 150 OTPs, and after removing 7 of them for various reasons, we attempted to interview the remaining 143 OTPs from June 4 through June 22, 2020.  We received responses from 142 OTPs, located in 37 States and the District of Columbia (137 urban areas and 5 rural areas)., OTPs reported a variety of: (1) challenges they have encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) actions they have taken to address those challenges while ensuring the continuity of needed services and protecting the health and safety of their patients and staff., OTPs reported challenges related to: (1) maintaining pre-pandemic service levels (124 OTPs); (2) managing impacts on facility operations (113 OTPs); (3) implementing and using telehealth (87 OTPs); (4) obtaining treatment medications, personal protective equipment, and cleaning supplies (83 OTPs); (5) maintaining patient participation in OTP activities (77 OTPs); (6) dealing with limitations posed by existing Federal guidance (65 OTPs); (7) providing take-home doses to patients (51 OTPs); and (8) implementing governmental guidance (34 OTPs)., OTPs reported actions taken, including: (1) encouraging or requiring various personal safety measures for patients and staff (141 OTPs), (2) implementing or expanding the use of telehealth to continue providing services (128 OTPs), (3) increasing the number of take-home doses to reduce the number of patients visiting facilities (127 OTPs), (4) making physical changes to facilities and increasing staffing flexibilities (121 OTPs), and (5) ensuring that patients received treatment medications (92 OTPs)., The information in this report was gathered to support HHS's goal of reducing opioid morbidity and mortality and to help SAMHSA by providing information on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on OTPs.

629,OEI-09-20-00450,"Despite Savings on Many Lab Tests in 2019, Total Medicare Spending Increased Slightly Because of Increased Utilization for Certain High-Priced Tests OEI-09-20-00450 12-18-2020","The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) changed the way the Medicare program sets payment rates for clinical diagnostic laboratory (lab) tests by aligning Medicare payment rates with private payment rates.  Prior to PAMA, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that Medicare was paying significantly more than other payers for many lab tests.  As part of PAMA, Congress also mandated that OIG publicly release an annual analysis of the top 25 tests based on Medicare spending.  This data brief provides analysis of Medicare payments for lab tests in 2019, the second year of the new payment system. , We analyzed all claims for lab tests performed in 2019 and paid for under the Medicare Part B Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS).  We identified key statistics and emerging trends for the top 25?lab tests based on Medicare spending in 2019. , Despite payment rate reductions on many lab tests, Medicare Part B spending increased slightly to $7.68 billion, a $93 million increase from 2018.  Similarly, Medicare expenditures on the top 25 tests increased slightly in 2019 and analysis of these tests illustrates 2 trends that led to these spending outcomes. , First, 17 tests (among the top 25 tests) had payment rate reductions required under PAMA.  For this group, overall Medicare spending decreased in 2019 compared to 2018.  Second, payment rates for the remaining 8 tests (among the top 25) did not change in 2019, and overall Medicare spending for this group increased compared to 2018.  Payment rates for these tests did not change either because their payment rates had already reached the rate required by PAMA, or the tests were relatively new to the CLFS and not yet affected by PAMA rate reductions.  , Our analysis of Medicare Part B spending on lab tests demonstrates that the payment rate adjustment required by PAMA achieved expected savings for some lab tests that had payment rate reductions in 2019.  However, the savings that resulted from lower rates were overtaken by increased Medicare spending on lab tests that had no payment rate change in 2019, including certain high-priced genetic tests. "
630,OEI-02-20-00400,Opioid Use in Medicare Part D During the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic OEI-02-20-00400 02-02-2021,"Concerns about the use of opioids in Medicare Part D and the availability of treatment for opioid use disorder have heightened with the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  COVID-19 poses specific dangers for people using opioids, as respiratory diseases like COVID-19 can increase the risk of fatal overdose among those taking opioids and those with opioid use disorder are more likely to contract COVID-19 and suffer complications. , It is imperative that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) closely monitor opioid use during this unprecedented time.  From 2016 to 2019, Medicare Part D saw a steady decline in opioid use, along with an increased use of drugs for treatment of opioid use disorder.  This data snapshot describes opioid use in Part D during the onset of COVID-19, focusing on the first 8 months of 2020.  For context, this snapshot also provides data on the first 8 months of 2019., This data snapshot provides the first look at opioid use and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented and extraordinarily challenging time for this country's healthcare system.  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of Americans, vigilance remains essential.  OIG is committed to continuing our work on opioid use and access to treatment.  CMS has also continued its efforts to prevent inappropriate prescribing of opioids and to ensure access to treatment during the pandemic.  In addition to CMS's continuing these efforts, it is essential that CMS—and HHS—monitor trends in prescriptions for drugs for medication-assisted treatment and naloxone and take appropriate action if the number of prescriptions begins to fall off.

632,OEI-BL-20-00260,SAMHSA Is Missing Opportunities To Better Monitor Access to Medication Assisted Treatment Through the Buprenorphine Waiver Program OEI-BL-20-00260 06-14-2021,"Related Content: <a href=""https://hhs-oig-geo-hub-hhsoigbeta.hub.arcgis.com/apps/b9963de2160f44839550115c4c37fdea/explore"">Behavioral HealthMedication-Assisted Treatment Viewer Story Map</a>, Combating the opioid crisis by expanding treatment services is a key priority for SAMHSA.  The Buprenorphine Waiver Program-one of SAMHSA's primary initiatives to address this priority-currently authorizes 90,000 providers to provide medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to patients with opioid use disorder.  However, SAMHSA does not know how many total patients actually receive MAT through the program because it does not collect this information from all enrolled providers., SAMHSA requires a subset of 6,000 waivered providers-those authorized to treat the maximum number of patients allowed by law (i.e., 275)-to annually report the number of patients to whom they provided MAT.  The primary purpose of this annual reporting requirement is to allow SAMHSA to monitor providers' compliance with additional requirements in place for providers authorized at this 275-patient limit.  However, because these data constitute the only information that SAMHSA currently collects from waivered providers, OIG used the data to examine the waiver program's success in a broader goal-expanding access to treatment.  Although they represent only a small percentage of waivered providers, the 6,000 providers approved at the maximum patient level are important for access to MAT, because they are permitted to treat a much greater patient load and often specialize in addiction treatment.  We examined how many providers submitted the required annual report during 2019.  For the latest month with complete data (June 2019), we examined the number of MAT patients whom each provider reported treating and whether providers located in counties with a high need for MAT services treated more patients than providers located elsewhere., In 2019, 77 percent of providers who were waivered at the 275-patient level did not submit required data to SAMHSA regarding the number of MAT patients they served.  SAMHSA says that it has opted to exercise its discretion and not enforce the reporting requirements because the opioid crisis is a public health emergency and it does not want to disrupt patients' access to MAT services.  According to the limited data available, providers treated an average of 116 MAT patients-far below the 275-patient limit.  Additionally, providers located in high-need counties reported treating more MAT patients on average than providers located elsewhere-127 versus 107 patients, respectively. , Without valid data about waivered providers' patient loads and prescribing practices, SAMHSA lacks consistent, reliable information with which to monitor patient access and identify unmet needs for MAT services.  OIG recommends that SAMHSA develop methods to better measure access to MAT via office-based providers.  As policymakers consider changes to the waiver program, it will be critical to have valid data on the number of patients accessing MAT.  With improved data, SAMHSA could better do the following:  understand providers' MAT prescribing practices; monitor trends in the number of MAT patients being served; identify geographic areas where patients with opioid use disorder remain underserved; and target where to deploy its training and technical assistance resources.  SAMHSA concurred with this recommendation."
633,OEI-02-20-00390,Many Medicare Beneficiaries Are Not Receiving Medication to Treat Their Opioid Use Disorder OEI-02-20-00390 12-15-2021,"See Also: <a href=""https://hhs-oig-geo-hub-hhsoigbeta.hub.arcgis.com/app/b9963de2160f44839550115c4c37fdea"">Behavioral Health Medication Assisted Treatment Viewer</a>, Opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States are at an all-time high, reaching an estimated 70,000 deaths in 2020.  As the country continues to struggle with the opioid crisis, it is critical that people who are suffering from opioid use disorder have access to treatment.  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made this need even more urgent, particularly because the toll it has taken on beneficiaries' mental health and the extent to which it has increased the number of beneficiaries suffering from opioid use disorder are not yet known., Opioid use disorder-a problematic pattern of opioid use that leads to clinically significant impairment or distress-is a chronic disease that can be treated with certain medications.  These medications have been shown to decrease illicit opioid use and opioid-related overdose deaths.  The combination of these medications with behavioral therapy is referred to as medication-assisted treatment.  , Medicare plays an important role in ensuring that beneficiaries with opioid use disorder have access to treatment.  Three medications are approved for the treatment of opioid use disorder: buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone.  Beneficiaries can receive these drugs in office-based settings or from opioid treatment programs.  To prescribe or administer buprenorphine in office-based settings, providers must receive a waiver through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  In addition, opioid treatment programs are the only outpatient settings allowed to administer and dispense methadone., We analyzed claims from Medicare Parts B, C, and D to determine the extent to which beneficiaries diagnosed with opioid use disorder received medication and behavioral therapy to treat their opioid use disorder through Medicare in 2020.  , About 1 million Medicare beneficiaries were diagnosed with opioid use disorder in 2020.  Yet less than 16 percent of these beneficiaries received medication to treat their opioid use disorder, raising concerns that beneficiaries face challenges accessing treatment.  Furthermore, less than half of the beneficiaries who received medication to treat their opioid use disorder also received behavioral therapy.  These services may be provided in-person or via telehealth; however, the full extent to which beneficiaries use telehealth for behavioral therapy is unknown as Medicare does not require opioid treatment programs to report this information.  , In addition, beneficiaries in Florida, Texas, Nevada, and Kansas were less likely to receive medication to treat their opioid use disorder than beneficiaries nationwide.  Furthermore, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and Black beneficiaries were less likely to receive medication than White beneficiaries.  Older beneficiaries and those who did not receive the Part D low-income subsidy were also less likely to receive medication to treat their opioid use disorder.  , These findings show a need to increase the number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving treatment for opioid use disorder.  Accordingly, we recommend that CMS take these steps: (1) conduct additional outreach to beneficiaries to increase awareness about Medicare coverage for the treatment of opioid use disorder; (2) take steps to increase the number of providers and opioid treatment programs for Medicare beneficiaries with opioid use disorder; (3) assist SAMHSA by providing data about the number of Medicare beneficiaries receiving buprenorphine in office-based settings and the geographic areas where Medicare beneficiaries remain underserved; (4) take steps to increase the utilization of behavioral therapy among beneficiaries receiving medication to treat opioid use disorder; (5) create an action plan and take steps to address disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder; and (6) collect data on the use of telehealth in opioid treatment programs.  CMS concurred with four of our recommendations and did not explicitly indicate whether it concurred with two of our recommendations."

Medicare beneficiaries have been particularly affected and remain vulnerable to new variants and additional surges of the virus.  Clinicians and researchers are still working to fully understand the damage to the body from the disease and what underlying chronic conditions potentially lead to more severe complications or hospitalization., Understanding the types of conditions for which Medicare beneficiaries with COVID-19 are being treated and who was more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 can help hospitals and health officials better prepare for and address the wide-ranging and extensive needs of COVID 19 patients, particularly in the event of localized surges of cases.  Such knowledge will also assist in the Federal, State, and local response to the pandemic by providing a better picture of the needs of these hospitalized beneficiaries., This report describes the complex care needs of beneficiaries hospitalized with COVID-19.  It focuses on surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations in six localities and builds upon prior OIG work that describes the extent to which hospitals have been strained by COVID-19.  As we noted in the 2021 report about hospital experiences during the pandemic, hospitals have been operating in ""survival mode"" for an extended period of time.  They have also experienced difficulty balancing the complex and resource-intensive care needed for COVID-19 patients with efforts to resume routine hospital care., We reviewed hospital inpatient claims and enrollment data to identify all Medicare beneficiaries who were hospitalized in a short-term acute-care hospital at any point from April 1 through July 31, 2020.  We then identified six localities that experienced a surge in hospitalizations of Medicare beneficiaries with COVID-19 over a 3-week period.  We analyzed the diagnoses on the claims of beneficiaries hospitalized with COVID-19 in those six selected localities to identify the conditions for which they were treated during their hospital stays.  The percentages presented in this report represent averages among the six localities., During surges in hospitalizations, hospitals in the six localities treated Medicare beneficiaries with COVID-19 for a wide range of serious, complex conditions.  Almost all of these beneficiaries were treated for acute respiratory issues, such as viral pneumonia.  Many of these beneficiaries were also treated for other types of serious conditions including:, More than 50 percent of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with COVID-19 received intensive care or mechanical ventilation.  Additionally, dually eligible, Black, Hispanic, or older beneficiaries were disproportionately hospitalized with COVID-19 relative to the Medicare population in these localities.  , The complex needs of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries—combined with surges in hospitalizations-may create substantial challenges in meeting the needs of these patients, particularly in light of the staffing and other problems that hospitals have reported.  Gaining a better understanding of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with COVID-19—including the conditions for which they were being treated and demographic characteristics—can assist Federal, State, and local efforts in the COVID-19 pandemic and may be used to provide additional guidance to hospitals.  This information can also help hospitals, physicians, and other practitioners better prepare for the complex and resource-intensive care needs of Medicare beneficiaries with COVID-19, which may be particularly important during continued surges of the virus.  CMS can also use this information to identify beneficiaries who are particularly vulnerable to hospitalization as well as to understand the needs of these beneficiaries during their hospitalizations.  In addition, this analysis shows that Medicare claims data can be used to enhance our knowledge of the treatment of COVID-19 and help inform additional research efforts.  "
637,OEI-02-20-00520,Telehealth Was Critical for Providing Services to Medicare Beneficiaries During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic OEI-02-20-00520 03-15-2022,"The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for how Medicare beneficiaries accessed health care.  In response, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) took a number of actions to temporarily expand access to telehealth for Medicare beneficiaries.  CMS allowed beneficiaries to use telehealth for a wide range of services; it also allowed beneficiaries to use telehealth in different locations, including in urban areas and from the beneficiary's home.  , This data brief provides insight into the use of telehealth in both Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 2020 through February 2021.  It is a companion to a report that examines the characteristics of beneficiaries who used telehealth during the pandemic.  Another report in this series identifies program integrity concerns related to telehealth during the pandemic.  Understanding the use of telehealth during the first year of the pandemic can shed light on how the temporary expansion of telehealth affected where and how beneficiaries accessed their health care.  This information can help CMS, Congress, and other stakeholders make decisions about how telehealth can be best used to meet the needs of beneficiaries in the future., We based this analysis on Medicare fee-for-service claims data and Medicare Advantage encounter data from March 1, 2020, to February 28, 2021, and from the prior year, March 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020.  We used these data to determine the total number of services used via telehealth and in-person, as well as the types of services used.  We also compared the number of services used via telehealth and in-person during the first year of the pandemic to those used in the prior year. , Over 28 million Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth during the first year of the pandemic.  This was more than 2 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries.  In total, beneficiaries used 88 times more telehealth services during the first year of the pandemic than they used in the prior year.  Beneficiaries' use of telehealth peaked in April 2020 and remained high through early 2021.  Overall, beneficiaries used telehealth to receive 12 percent of their services during the first year of the pandemic.  Beneficiaries most commonly used telehealth for office visits, which accounted for just under half of all telehealth services used during the first year of the pandemic.  However, beneficiaries' use of telehealth for behavioral health services stands out.  Beneficiaries used telehealth for a larger share of their behavioral health services compared to their use of telehealth for other services.  Specifically, beneficiaries used telehealth for 43 percent of behavioral health services, whereas they used telehealth for 13 percent of office visits. , Telehealth was critical for providing services to Medicare beneficiaries during the first year of the pandemic.  Beneficiaries' use of telehealth during the pandemic also demonstrates the long-term potential of telehealth to increase access to health care for beneficiaries.  Further, it shows that beneficiaries particularly benefited from the ability to use telehealth for certain services, such as behavioral health services.  These findings are important for CMS, Congress, and other stakeholders to take into account as they consider making changes to telehealth in Medicare.  For example, CMS could use these findings to inform changes to the services that are allowed via telehealth on a permanent basis."

640,A-07-21-03248,Missouri Properly Converted Provisionally Enrolled Medicaid Providers to Permanent Providers,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Secretary of Health and Human Services temporarily waived certain Medicaid provider enrollment requirements., Loosening of provider screening requirements increases Medicaid vulnerability to fraud by moderate and high-risk providers.  Because of the speed with which established provider enrollment requirements have been waived or modified, we believe that the opportunity for abuse of the Medicaid system could result in unallowable billing, duplication of services, breach of confidentiality, identity theft, and ineffective or unsafe care., Our objectives were to determine whether Missouri: (1) followed up with provisionally enrolled Medicaid providers to ensure that all documentation was obtained according to applicable provider screening and enrollment requirements after regular enrollment practices resumed and (2) had effective controls over the provisional enrollment process during the public health emergency for the period of March 1, 2020, through May 15, 2020., We selected a stratified random sample of 100 provisionally enrolled providers (of the 1,036 during our audit period) and reviewed their documentation to determine whether they were properly converted to permanent providers or terminated by May 15, 2020., Missouri correctly followed up with the provisionally enrolled Medicaid providers to ensure that all documentation was obtained in accordance with applicable provider screening and enrollment requirements, or that the Medicaid provider was terminated, after the regular enrollment practices resumed for all 100 sampled provisionally enrolled Medicaid providers.  Missouri's provisional enrollment process involved tracking provisionally enrolled providers on a spreadsheet and terminating them if they did not provide the necessary documents required for a regular enrollment.  Because we identified no errors in our sample review, we concluded that Missouri's controls over the provisional enrollment process were effective., Missouri stated that it was pleased that no findings were identified during our sample review and added that it ""remains committed to this level of work."", Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

642,OEI-05-20-00480,Medicare Part D and Beneficiaries Could Realize Significant Spending Reductions With Increased Biosimilar Use,"Biologics—usually large, complex molecules produced in a living system—are some of the most expensive drugs available, and spending for biologics is growing in Medicare Part D because they treat diseases common among Medicare beneficiaries.  Biologics are estimated to cost Part D upwards of $12 billion annually., A biosimilar is a lower cost biologic that is highly similar to an existing biologic approved by the Food and Drug Administration (i.e., the biosimilar's ""reference product"")., Although a limited number of biosimilars are currently available for Part D covered reference products, multiple biosimilars for Humira—the best selling prescription drug in the world—are expected to be available in 2023, thereby presenting an opportunity to significantly decrease Part D drug costs., We analyzed biosimilar utilization and spending in Part D from 2015 to 2019.  We also calculated multiple estimates to explore how Part D and beneficiary spending in 2019 could have changed with increased utilization of biosimilars., Lastly, we determined the extent to which Part D plan formularies encouraged the use of biosimilars rather than reference products.  Specifically, we examined whether biosimilars were included on Part D plan formularies and, if so, whether they were on a less preferential tier or subject to different utilization management requirements than their reference products., Since biosimilars were introduced in 2015, use of and spending on these drugs in Part D has steadily increased.  However, they are still used far less frequently than their higher cost reference product alternatives.  In 2019, biosimilars' reference products were still prescribed about five times more frequently than biosimilars in Part D., We estimated that with increased use of biosimilars instead of reference products, Part D and beneficiary spending could have been considerably reduced in 2019.  Specifically, Part D spending on biologics with available biosimilars could have decreased by $84 million, or 18 percent, if all biosimilars had been used as frequently as the most used biosimilars.  Additionally, beneficiaries' out of pocket costs for these drugs could have decreased by $1.8 million, or 12 percent.  Although these amounts are modest in the context of overall Part D spending, far greater spending reductions will be possible as additional biosimilars become available., Biosimilars have the potential to significantly reduce costs for Part D and beneficiaries if their use becomes more widespread, particularly with the expected launches of biosimilars for blockbuster drugs Humira and Enbrel.  However, a lack of biosimilar coverage on Part D formularies could limit this wider utilization.  In 2019, not all plan formularies covered available biosimilars.  Moreover, those formularies that did cover biosimilars rarely encouraged their use over reference products through preferential formulary tier placement and utilization management tools., Without further changes to the Part D program, the impact of limited coverage and promotion of biosimilars on formularies may be magnified as biosimilars for blockbuster drugs become available.  To help ensure that Part D and beneficiaries can capitalize on potential savings, we recommend that CMS encourage plans to increase access to and use of biosimilars in Part D.  We also recommend that CMS monitor biosimilar coverage on formularies to identify concerning trends.  CMS concurred with our first recommendation and neither concurred nor nonconcurred with our second recommendation."

This may create financial incentives for MA companies to make beneficiaries appear as sick as possible.  For CMS to risk-adjust payments, MA companies report beneficiaries' diagnoses-based on services provided to beneficiaries-to CMS's MA encounter data system and the Risk Adjustment Processing System., Chart reviews and health risk assessments (HRAs) are allowable sources of diagnoses for risk adjustment.  A chart review is an MA company's review of a beneficiary's medical record to identify diagnoses that a provider did not submit or submitted in error.  An HRA occurs when-in order to diagnose a beneficiary and identify possible gaps in care-a health care professional collects information from a beneficiary about the beneficiary's health., We undertook this evaluation because of concerns that MA companies may leverage both chart reviews and HRAs to maximize risk adjusted payments, without beneficiaries receiving care for those diagnoses.  Unsupported risk adjusted payments have been a major driver of improper payments in the MA program.  The risk adjustment program is an important payment mechanism for MA.  It levels the playing field for MA companies that enroll beneficiaries who need a costlier level of care, which helps to ensure that these beneficiaries have continued access to MA plans.  Chart reviews and HRAs can be tools for improving the MA program.  However, two prior OIG evaluations found that the diagnoses that MA companies reported only on chart reviews or HRAs in the 2016 encounter data-i.e., on no other service records-resulted in billions in risk-adjusted payments for 2017.  These prior evaluations raised concerns about the completeness of encounter data; the validity of submitted diagnoses on chart reviews or HRAs; and the quality of care provided to MA beneficiaries.  The current evaluation builds on those two evaluations to identify MA companies that disproportionately drove increases in risk adjusted payments from both chart reviews and HRAs. , Using previously collected MA encounter data from 2016, we determined whether any MA companies' use of chart reviews and HRAs increased their risk adjusted payments disproportionately relative to their size and their peers., Our findings raise concerns about the extent to which certain MA companies may have inappropriately leveraged both chart reviews and HRAs to maximize risk adjusted payments.  We found that 20 of the 162 MA companies drove a disproportionate share of the $9.2 billion in payments from diagnoses that were reported only on chart reviews and HRAs, and on no other service records.  These companies' higher share of payments could not be explained by the size of their beneficiary enrollment.  Each company generated a share of payments from these chart reviews and HRAs that was more than 25 percent higher than its share of enrolled MA beneficiaries.  Among these 20 MA companies, 1 company further stood out in its use of chart reviews and HRAs to drive risk adjusted payments without encounter records of any other services provided to the beneficiaries for those diagnoses.  This company had 40 percent of the risk-adjusted payments from both mechanisms, yet enrolled only 22 percent of MA beneficiaries.  In addition, this company accounted for about a third of all payments from diagnoses reported solely on chart reviews and more than half of all payments from diagnoses reported solely on HRAs.  Further, almost all of its HRAs were conducted in beneficiaries' homes.  Since in-home HRAs are often conducted by vendors hired by MA companies (and not likely conducted by beneficiaries' primary care providers), this raises particular concerns about the quality of care coordination for these beneficiaries and the validity of diagnoses that were reported om the HRAs., CMS should (1) provide oversight of the 20 MA companies that had a disproportionate share of the risk-adjusted payments from chart reviews and HRAs; (2) take additional actions to determine the appropriateness of payments and care for the 1 MA company that substantially drove risk adjusted payments from chart reviews and HRAs; and (3) perform periodic monitoring to identify MA companies that had a disproportionate share of risk adjusted payments from chart reviews and HRAs.  To assist CMS with its efforts, we will provide information on which companies had a substantially disproportionate share of risk adjusted payments from diagnoses that were reported only on chart reviews and/or HRAs.  CMS neither concurred nor nonconcurred with our three recommendations and stated that it will take our recommendations under consideration as part of its ongoing process to determine policy options for future years."

Contract closeout is the final phase in a contract's life cycle and is a key step in ensuring that the contracting agency has received the appropriate goods and services at the agreed-upon price.  This audit is part of a broad portfolio of OIG reviews examining various aspects of acquisition contracting throughout HHS., Our objectives were to determine whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): (1) identified and reviewed contracts when they were eligible for closeout and (2) closed contracts in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR), and other HHS acquisition policies and procedures., We reviewed: (1) 30 FDA contracts that had an ultimate completion date that was before November 2, 2015, (2) 10 open FDA contracts that were awarded by FDA and had a contract action between October 1, 2014, and June 30, 2020, and (3) 5 closed contracts that were awarded by FDA and had a contract action between October 1, 2014, through June 30, 2020., FDA did not always identify contracts eligible for closeout and did not always follow FAR requirements for closing contracts timely but otherwise generally closed contracts in accordance with the FAR, the HHSAR, and other HHS acquisition policies and procedures.  FDA did not always identify and close contracts timely because FDA utilized manual processes for some contract closeout review functions when an automated process may have been more efficient.  In addition, FDA personnel did not always communicate to each other information that would have helped identify contracts eligible for closeout, contracting officers and contracting officer's representatives (CORs) were not required to notify contract closeout specialists that a contract was complete, and the CORs' change requests were not always submitted before the CORs left their positions.  Finally, FDA contract closeout specialists did not have the ability to run ad hoc query reports from the Purchase Request Information System, the system HHS uses to formulate, administer, and distribute contract documents.  , Because contracts were not always closed timely, FDA may not have identified unused funds that could be deobligated and released to another appropriate need.  Specifically, we found that two of the contracts that should have been closed had remaining funds of $88,152 that should have been deobligated and released to another appropriate need., We recommend that FDA deobligate $88,152 in contract funding and close the six contracts that remain open but eligible for closeout.  We also made several procedural recommendations for improving the contract closeout process.  Our detailed recommendations are in the report., In written comments on our draft report, FDA concurred with five of our recommendations and accepted the intent of the other recommendation.  FDA described corrective actions that it had taken or planned to take in response to each of our recommendations. For example, FDA agreed to add language to the contract awards to require that contractors specify whether an invoice is the final contract invoice, plans to deobligate $88,152 in contract funding, and is seeking a solution to automate both the tracking of awards for closeout and the process of sending closeout documents to the contractor and COR., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/fda.asp"">Food and Drug Administration</a>"
647,OEI-03-19-00432,Medicare Advantage Organizations Are Missing Opportunities To Use Ordering Provider Identifiers To Protect Program Integrity OEI-03-19-00432 04-02-2021,"National Provider Identifiers (NPIs) for ordering providers are essential for safeguarding the program integrity of what we refer to in this issue brief as high-risk services in Medicare-i.e., durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS); clinical laboratory services; imaging services; and home health services.  For these services, NPIs are critical for identifying patterns of inappropriate billing and ordering among providers and investigating fraud and abuse.  Both CMS and OIG rely on ordering provider NPIs (hereafter ordering NPIs) to conduct oversight and pursue fraud investigations.  However, prior OIG work found that these NPIs were largely absent from CMS's MA encounter data, despite evidence that many MAOs can-and do-already collect this information.  As a result, OIG recommended that CMS establish and enforce requirements for MAOs to submit ordering NPIs for high-risk services.  Findings from this issue brief may be useful as CMS considers requiring MAOs to collect and use ordering NPIs for MAOs' program integrity oversight activities., To determine the extent to which MAOs conducted program integrity oversight activities by using ordering NPIs submitted by providers and/or suppliers of high-risk services, we administered an online survey to a stratified random sample of 200 MAOs from February to March 2020.  We received responses from 179 MAOs.  This is the second OIG issue brief that analyzes data from this survey; the first was released in August 2020 and focused on the extent to which MAOs collected ordering NPIs and submitted these identifiers to CMS's MA Encounter Data System., Almost half of the MAOs that lack ordering NPIs on at least some MA encounter records raised concerns that this hinders their data analysis for program integrity.  Among MAOs that collect any ordering NPIs, most use these NPIs to conduct oversight activities-such as analyses that detect potential fraud schemes-but one in five of these MAOs does not perform program integrity oversight using ordering NPIs, despite having the data to do so.  Furthermore, when MAOs collect ordering NPIs on MA encounter records, most do not validate these NPIs against CMS's NPI registry.  These findings indicate that there are unrealized opportunities for MAOs to use ordering NPIs to protect the MA program against fraud and abuse., OIG recommends that CMS encourage MAOs to perform program integrity oversight using ordering NPIs.  CMS neither concurred nor nonconcurred with this recommendation and stated that it would consider whether additional education is needed for MAOs regarding the role that ordering NPIs can play in program integrity oversight."

Home health agencies (HHAs) must comply with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) infection prevention and control requirements and follow CMS guidance by having policies and procedures to protect HHA staff, Medicare beneficiaries, and caregivers during the pandemic., Our objective was to determine whether eight selected HHAs had infection control policies and procedures that complied with CMS requirements and followed CMS guidance to safeguard HHA staff, Medicare beneficiaries, and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic., Our audit covered the infection prevention and control policies and procedures for eight HHA providers.  We reviewed each HHA provider's policies and procedures to determine whether they include: (1) guidance for following standards of practice, (2) a coordinated agencywide infection control program, and (3) infection control education for HHA staff, Medicare beneficiaries, and caregivers.  We also determined whether the HHA providers' policies and procedures followed CMS COVID-19 guidance for: (1) screening patients, (2) screening staff, and (3) treating patients with known or suspected COVID-19., Six of the eight selected HHA providers had infection control policies and procedures that complied with CMS requirements and followed CMS guidance to safeguard HHA staff, Medicare beneficiaries, and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, one HHA provider did not comply with CMS requirements or follow CMS COVID-19 guidance.  Specifically, this HHA provider's infection control policies and procedures did not: (1) require staff to follow one of the standard precautions to prevent the transmission of infections and communicable diseases, (2) include documentation of surveillance methods used for identifying and tracking infections and improvement activities to prevent infection, (3) include COVID-19 screening protocols for staff in accordance with CMS guidance, and (4) include information about how to care for patients with known or suspected COVID-19 in accordance with CMS guidance.  In addition, this provider and another HHA provider's COVID-19 screening protocols for patients were not consistent with CMS guidance.  As a result, the patients and staff at these two HHA providers were at an increased risk of infection.  We did not determine whether these HHA providers had infection prevention and control issues related to the implementation of the policies and procedures.  However, State survey agencies identified issues with implementation at several of these HHA providers, as indicated by infection prevention and control deficiencies found during surveys conducted in 2019 and 2020., We recommend that CMS develop and share with the HHA industry information on COVID-19 infection prevention and control best practices that HHA providers can use to comply with CMS requirements and follow CMS guidance., CMS concurred with our recommendation.  CMS stated that it has provided education and outreach to HHAs on CMS quality and safety standards to support their infection prevention and control efforts.  CMS also stated that it will continue to share information on best practices with the HHA industry., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"
650,OEI-BL-20-00670,HHS Should Improve Internal Coordination Regarding Unaccompanied Children OEI-BL-20-00670 05-02-2022,"OIG initiated this review to assess coordination within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding a CDC public health order that significantly affected operations of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a program office within ACF.  Specifically, in March 2020, citing the risk of COVID-19, CDC issued a ""Title 42 order"" to suspend entry of certain persons into the United States.  Under that order, most noncitizen children entering the United States without a parent (""unaccompanied children"") were expelled to their home countries.  Before the Title 42 order, these children generally would have been referred to ORR, which provides temporary care for unaccompanied children until they are released to a sponsor or otherwise leave ORR custody.  Therefore, as a result of the Title 42 order, the number of children in ORR's care dropped substantially.  Our retrospective analysis of the Title 42 order's development and initial implementation in 2020 serves to identify steps that HHS can take to improve internal coordination in the future and better ensure that ORR has the information necessary to effectively care for unaccompanied children., This review focuses primarily on events that occurred from March through November 2020.  , Our findings are based on interviews with officials and staff within CDC and ACF; written responses to questions submitted to CDC, ACF, and others within HHS; and internal HHS documents, such as emails and memoranda.  We also reviewed relevant public documents.  We conducted a qualitative analysis of these materials to establish the timeline and content of coordination between CDC and ORR; the context for that coordination; and factors that assisted or challenged effective coordination to protect the well-being of unaccompanied children and to address the impact of the Title 42 order on ORR operations., Despite the Title 42 order's impact on ORR, OIG found that CDC did not inform the Assistant Secretary for ACF, the ORR Director, or ORR career staff in advance about the Title 42 order.  This lack of communication was due, in part, to the fact that CDC career staff who typically coordinate with ORR staff regarding migration-related health issues were not involved in developing or managing the Title 42 order., OIG also found a lack of communication during the Title 42 order's ongoing implementation.  Approximately 2,000 children were excepted from the order and referred to ORR's care between April and September 2020.  However, ORR staff reported that they had not been informed about criteria for these exceptions.  Incomplete information about the factors driving referrals can complicate efforts to predict ORR's facility capacity and programmatic needs., Finally, OIG found that CDC did not inform ORR about a timeline or process for lifting the Title 42 order, despite the likelihood that this action would lead to a significant increase in the number of children referred to ORR and the need for ORR to rapidly increase capacity.  CDC reported to OIG that it considered a variety of factors to determine, every 30 days, whether the Title 42 order would remain in effect; however, CDC did not provide to OIG any targets or benchmarks associated with these criteria.  Without specific metrics that would trigger a decision to lift the Title 42 order, CDC had limited ability to advise ORR about a possible timeline for rescission. , Past OIG work noted that poor internal communication had impeded ORR's ability to provide prompt and appropriate care for unaccompanied children in 2018.  OIG's findings in this review demonstrate a similar lack of internal communication regarding unaccompanied children from March through November 2020, during the development and early implementation of CDC's Title 42 order.  Given these findings, as well as OIG's prior findings regarding poor internal communication about unaccompanied children, OIG recommends that HHS: (1) take steps to improve internal coordination and communication about unaccompanied children and (2) ensure that CDC coordinates with ORR when making future decisions that could affect the number of unaccompanied children placed in ORR's care, including any Title 42 order., ACF and CDC concurred with both of our recommendations.  ACF stated that it has already taken significant steps to implement the recommendations and affirmed that it will continue these efforts to support effective operation of the Unaccompanied Children Program.  CDC also provided examples of recent coordination and stated that it will continue to improve internal coordination and communication efforts."
651,OEI-BL-20-00680,"Characteristics of Separated Children in ORR's Care: June 27, 2018–November 15, 2020 OEI-BL-20-00680 11-12-2021","OIG initiated this review to inform policymakers, stakeholders, and the public about the number and circumstances of separated children who have been placed in the care of ACF's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) since June 26, 2018.  Most children referred to ORR by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have surrendered to or been apprehended by immigration officials while entering the United States without a parent or legal guardian.  However, some children enter the United States with a parent or legal guardian but are subsequently separated from that adult by DHS officials and then referred to ORR.  (We refer to these two categories of children as ""non-separated children"" and ""separated children,"" respectively.)  Prior OIG work identified challenges that ORR faced in addressing the mental health needs of separated children and efficiently identifying appropriate sponsors for their release., We obtained and analyzed ORR's data about all children referred to ORR between June 27, 2018 (the day after a Federal district court halted most family separations, subject to certain exceptions) and November 15, 2020 (the date of the most recent complete data available at the time of our review).  We identified all children's demographic characteristics, lengths of stay, and release outcomes, and we compared separated children to all other children referred to ORR (i.e., non separated children).  For separated children, we analyzed data that DHS provided to ORR to identify and categorize the reasons children were separated from parents or legal guardians.  Finally, we interviewed ORR program staff about their observations regarding family separation as well as challenges that they experienced in receiving from DHS complete and accurate information about parents' backgrounds., In total, 1,178 children were separated from a parent or legal guardian and referred to ORR's care between June 27, 2018, and November 15, 2020.  Separated children were 9 years old on average, with more than a quarter under 5 years old.  In comparison, non-separated children were 15 years old on average, with only 3 percent under 5 years old.  
We also found that 70 percent of separated children referred to ORR had been separated from a parent by immigration officials because of that parent's criminal history.  The types of criminal histories that prompted separations varied widely, from homicide to traffic-related offenses.  , Finally, we found that separated children spent longer in ORR's care and were less likely than non-separated children to be released to a sponsor (i.e., an adult in the United States who can assume custody).  Separated children were also more likely than non-separated children to have been released through voluntary departure to their home countries.  Of the 1,178 separated children referred to ORR during the period we reviewed, ORR ultimately reunified 182 children (15 percent) with the parent from whom the child was separated. , DHS—not ORR—decides when to separate a parent and child upon entry into the United States.  However, ORR must determine whether the child can be safely reunified with the separated parent and identify an alternative sponsor if needed.  Further, although separated children make up a small proportion of the population ORR serves, they have different characteristics and face substantial challenges.  With recent increases in the number of children entering ORR's care, it is important to understand why children are referred to ORR.  OIG's findings provide information to policymakers, stakeholders, and the public about family separations after June 26, 2018, and the characteristics, circumstances, and release outcomes of separated children placed in ORR's care."

The Federal Government generally uses OTs for high-risk, high-reward research and development projects.  Although OTs are subject to fewer restrictions than contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements, they must be awarded and administered in a way that ensures proper stewardship of Federal funds., From October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2019 (audit period), the NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) awarded $84.3 million in Federal funds under 29 OTs., Our objective was to determine whether NHLBI complied with applicable Federal requirements for awarding and administering OTs., Our audit covered a judgmental sample of 12 OTs totaling $71.9 million that NHLBI awarded and administered during the audit period., Our audit procedures focused on whether NHLBI documentation for the sampled OTs provided evidence of compliance with Federal requirements.  This audit is responsive to a U.S. Office of Special Counsel complaint referral., NHLBI did not fully comply with Federal requirements for awarding and administering OTs during our audit period.  For the 12 OTs in our sample, NHLBI did not adequately document: (1) its justifications for using OTs rather than traditional award instruments; (2) that awarded amounts were fair and reasonable and incurred costs were allowable; or (3) that it complied with Federal requirements for obligating annual appropriations., NHLBI did not adequately document its compliance with applicable Federal requirements because its internal controls for awarding and administering OTs were ineffective.  As a result, NHLBI could not ensure the proper stewardship of Federal funds used to award OTs, including the $71.9 million we reviewed., We recommend that NHLBI strengthen its internal controls for OTs by updating its policies and procedures to properly document its justifications for using OTs instead of traditional award instruments and to determine fairness and reasonableness of award amounts, allowability of costs, and compliance with Federal funding requirements., In written comments on our draft report, NIH concurred with our recommendations and said that it would update its policies and procedures by November 15, 2021, to reflect our recommendations., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/nih.asp"">National Institutes of Health </a>"

In 2012, OIG found that the Illinois MFCU's organizational structure conflicted with Federal requirements.  This onsite review examined this previously identified area of concern and the MFCU's performance and operations., We conducted the onsite review of the Illinois MFCU in November 2019.  Our review period covered Federal fiscal years 2017-2019.  We based our review on an analysis of data from eight sources: (1) Unit documentation, such as policies and procedures; (2) financial documentation; (3) interviews with key stakeholders; (4) interviews with Unit management; (5) survey of Unit staff; (6) review of a random sample of case files that were open at some point during the review period; (7) review of all convictions submitted to OIG for program exclusion and all adverse actions submitted to the National Practitioner Data Bank during the review period; and (8) observation of Unit operations. , We found that the Illinois MFCU generally operated in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and policy transmittals.  However, we made six findings regarding the Unit's adherence to MFCU performance standards: (1) the Unit's organizational structure created several staffing challenges, raising concerns about its operational efficiencies; (2) the Unit's process for receiving referrals of patient abuse and neglect led to the Unit's screening of thousands of referrals that were unsuitable for investigation, diverting time and resources from viable cases; (3) the Unit did not always coordinate on or actively participate in cases with Federal partners, missing opportunities for sharing resources and training; (4) the Unit did not always report convictions or adverse actions to Federal partners within the appropriate timeframes; (5) newly hired Unit investigators did not always complete new employee trainings, which could affect the Unit's overall effectiveness; and (6) although the Unit documented its periodic supervisory reviews in most of its case files, the Unit had difficulty adhering to its policies of conducting the reviews monthly. , To address these findings and further improve Unit operations, we recommend that the Unit (1) develop and implement a plan to address the challenges presented by the Unit's organizational structure (i.e., its location within the Illinois State Police, rather than within a State Attorney General's office like most other MFCUs); (2) establish minimum criteria for referrals of patient abuse and neglect to be sent to the MFCU; (3) establish a process to coordinate on cases and improve collaboration with Federal partners; (4) take steps to ensure that Unit staff report all convictions and adverse actions to Federal partners within the appropriate timeframes; (5) take steps to ensure that newly hired investigators complete new employee trainings; and (6) take steps to ensure that supervisory reviews of case files are conducted and documented in accordance with Unit policy.

The Unit did not take sufficient steps to ensure that it received quality referrals from the State Medicaid agency and other sources, and we found significant investigative delays; both factors affected the Unit's case outcomes.  Further, the Unit did not maintain regular communication and worked few cases jointly with Federal partners.  Unit management practices also resulted in inconsistent periodic supervisory reviews and documentation in Unit case files. , Additionally, we identified areas in which the Unit should improve its compliance with Federal regulations.  We found that the Unit did not report all convictions and adverse actions to Federal partners within the appropriate timeframes.  Further, the Unit's memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the State Medicaid agency lacked procedures by which the Unit would receive managed care referrals.  Finally, we found that the Unit did not exclude costs associated with non-MFCU activities from its Federal reimbursement request. , To address the findings identified in this report and improve case outcomes, we recommend that the Unit (1) develop and implement an action plan to reduce turnover of management and staff and to ensure continuity of Unit operations should turnover occur; (2) develop and implement an action plan to ensure that the Unit receives adequate quality referrals of fraud and patient abuse or neglect; (3) ensure that investigations are completed within the appropriate timeframes and that delays are documented; (4) improve communication and seek more opportunities to investigate cases jointly with Federal partners; (5) ensure that supervisory reviews of case files are conducted periodically and documented in accordance with Unit policy; (6) ensure that all convictions and adverse actions are reported to Federal partners within the appropriate timeframes; (7) revise the Unit's MOU with the State Medicaid agency to establish procedures by which the Unit will receive referrals of potential fraud from managed care organizations; and (8) ensure that costs associated with non-MFCU activities are excluded from the Unit's Federal reimbursement request.  The Unit concurred with all eight recommendations. "
662,OEI-12-20-00200,Mississippi Medicaid Fraud Control Unit: 2020 Inspection OEI-12-20-00200 08-13-2021,"OIG administers the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU or Unit) grant awards, annually recertifies the Units, and oversees the Units' performance in accordance with the requirements of the grant.  As part of this oversight, OIG conducts periodic reviews of Units and prepares public reports based on these reviews., OIG conducted the inspection of the Mississippi MFCU in August 2020 using a remote format.    Our inspection covered the 3-year period of FYs 2017 through 2019.  We based our inspection on an analysis of data and information from 6 sources: (1) Unit documentation; (2) financial documentation; (3) structured interviews with key stakeholders; (4) structured interviews with the Unit's managers and selected staff; (5) a review of a random sample of 100 case files from the 2,250 nonglobal case files that were open at some point during the review period; and (6) a review of all convictions submitted to OIG for program exclusion and all adverse actions submitted to the National Practitioner Data Bank during the review period., We found that reporting requirements contained in the Mississippi Vulnerable Persons Act imposed a significant workload on the Unit that led to many convictions of patient abuse or neglect but also presented challenges to Unit operations.  The Unit received about 2,000 complaints of patient abuse or neglect for each year of the review period and devoted half of its investigative staff and 90 percent of its caseload to patient abuse or neglect.  The Unit's chief investigator devoted more than half of his time to screening complaints and encountered difficulties conducting periodic supervisory reviews of the large caseload.  We also found significant unexplained investigative delays in 18 percent of cases. , We observed the Unit's fraud caseload and numbers of fraud convictions were low, compared to those of similarly sized MFCUs.  We found that the Unit took some steps to maintain an adequate volume and quality of fraud referrals, but its efforts to maintain fraud referrals from the Medicaid agency were inconsistent and the Unit received few fraud referrals.  Additionally, we found that the Unit maintained limited communication and coordination with OIG and stopped working joint cases with Federal partners in 2018., We also found that certain operational issues have persisted since OIG's prior onsite review in 2014.  We found that the Unit's policies and procedures manual did not reflect all aspects of Unit operations, including for periodic supervisory reviews.  We also found that the Unit did not timely report a substantial number of convictions to OIG for purposes of excluding providers from Federal health care programs, and that the Unit's timeliness declined significantly since OIG's 2014 onsite review.  , To address the findings about patient abuse or neglect and fraud cases, we recommend that the Unit (1) examine the Unit's intake process for complaints of patient abuse or neglect and identify improvements; (2) take steps to avoid investigation delays and ensure that delays are documented in the case files; (3) develop and implement a plan to increase fraud referrals from the Medicaid agency and other sources; and (4) improve communication and coordination with OIG investigators and other Federal partners.  We also make eight additional recommendations to address other findings related to the Unit's compliance with legal requirements and adherence to MFCU performance standards.  The Unit concurred with 11 of our recommendations and did not concur with 1 recommendation."

Government agencies implemented extensive community mitigation activities, including issuing shelter-in place orders.  Because of economic and other uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, victims may have been less likely to use crisis hotlines because their abusers were close by.  The National Domestic Violence Hotline (the Hotline) provides life-saving resources and safety planning services for victims of domestic violence., Our objectives were to: (1) identify trends in the Hotline's contact data before and during the pandemic and (2) identify challenges that the Hotline faced during the pandemic and actions that it took to address those challenges while continuing to support those affected by domestic violence., We obtained the Hotline's contact data for March 19, 2019, through March 18, 2021, and analyzed the following: contact volume and communication methods; demographic information (ethnicity, age group, and gender); situational information (abuse types, contact needs, barriers in service, and contact type); and referral information.  We also obtained the Hotline's feedback on our analysis.  We interviewed Hotline officials to identify challenges the Hotline faced during the pandemic and actions it took to address them., Although our analysis showed little change in total contact volume from the period before to the period during the pandemic, we identified notable changes in the contact data for some subcategories of data that we analyzed.  For example, the number of contacts that used online chat to contact the Hotline increased by 19 percent, the number of contacts that identified with the Asian ethnicity group increased by 24 percent, and the need for protective/restraining order assistance increased by 40 percent.  Furthermore, our analysis showed notable fluctuations in the number of contacts for some subcategories of data in certain months during the pandemic.  Although the Hotline provided explanations for what could have contributed to these fluctuations, it could not determine whether they were a result of the pandemic.  The Hotline believed that the full impact of the pandemic may not be reflected in the contact data until more time has passed. , The Hotline identified four challenges that it faced during the pandemic: (1) connecting victims to providers and resources that were operating at a limited capacity because of the pandemic, (2) tracking the unique impact of the pandemic on victims to better serve contacts' needs, (3) addressing a decrease in contact volume from victims who may have needed help but did not contact the Hotline because they were in closer proximity to their abusers as a result of shelter-in-place orders, and (4) fostering meaningful connections among Hotline staff to carry its mission forward.  To address these challenges, the Hotline took actions to help ensure that it continued to support those affected by domestic violence., This report includes no recommendations.  However, considering the information in this report may help the Hotline evaluate its emergency response to identify areas in which it can improve and to ensure that it addresses any long-term effects of the pandemic., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"
669,OEI-06-20-00700,Indian Health Service Use of Critical Care Response Teams Has Helped To Meet Facility Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic OEI-06-20-00700 09-17-2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, disease that has disproportionately affected American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).  IHS and Tribal health care facilities are the main health care providers for the AI/AN population.  Prior OIG work found that IHS facilities often lacked sufficient staff and had limited access to clinical specialists, as well as finding other quality-of-care concerns.  One recent IHS effort to address staffing and quality concerns is its development of Critical Care Response Teams (CCRTs) to support IHS and Tribal facilities in caring for critically ill COVID-19 patients.  This study examines IHS's first five deployments of the CCRTs, which provided services to six IHS facilities and three Tribal facilities from June through September 2020., We based our findings on document reviews and interviews with 74 key officials and staff at IHS headquarters, IHS Area Offices, IHS-operated facilities, and tribally operated facilities, as well as with contracted providers who served on the CCRTs.  We conducted data collection in December 2020 and January 2021.  We reviewed contracts and other documents related to IHS's deployment of the CCRTs.  Topics for the interviews included processes for deploying the teams; roles and expectations; and strategies used to address any challenges encountered during the deployments.  , IHS designed and launched the CCRT program within a few months of COVID-19's reaching the United States.  IHS awarded a contract in May 2020 to pilot the program and began receiving facility requests for CCRT deployments shortly thereafter.  IHS expedited the credentialing and onboarding process, and the first team arrived onsite at a tribally operated facility in June 2020.  CCRT teams consisted of a critical care physician, one or two critical care nurses, and a respiratory therapist, all deployed on short notice.  At the time of our review, IHS had fulfilled all requests for CCRTs in a timely manner.  While onsite, the CCRTs provided hands-on training to strengthen staff skills and capacity to handle surges of COVID-19 patients.  Facility administrators found the deployments, which typically lasted 2 weeks, valuable.  In interviews, IHS officials and staff credited the CCRT training with saving lives and stated that the teams' presence boosted staff's confidence and skills.  Although the CCRTs focused mostly on training staff, the teams also provided direct patient care, particularly during patient surges.  Throughout each CCRT deployment, facilities provided close oversight and communicated frequently with IHS headquarters and Area Offices about CCRT activities.  In January 2021, IHS awarded two contracts to extend the program through the pandemic.  Although none of the facilities in our sample planned to request another CCRT deployment, all facilities reported a need for similar resources to assist with non-COVID-19-related care., To further leverage the successes of the CCRT model in support of IHS's broader care improvement efforts, we recommend that IHS (1) solicit feedback from CCRTs regarding their observations of potential need for broader IHS-wide improvements beyond COVID-19-related care; (2) share the CCRTs' recommendations across all IHS and Tribal facilities; and (3) assess whether IHS could use the CCRT model to provide support and training for non-COVID-19-related care.  IHS concurred with our recommendations."

In fiscal year 2020, HHS awarded over $14 billion in contracts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Of these contracts, HHS's Assistant Secretary for Administration (ASA) awarded five sole source COVID-19 testing contracts to national pharmacy and grocery retail chains to provide Americans convenient access to COVID-19 testing at testing site locations throughout the United States.  The contracts provided a flat-fee payment to participating retailers for each test administered., Our objective was to determine whether ASA awarded and managed the COVID-19 testing contracts in accordance with applicable Federal regulations, and contract terms and conditions., Our audit covered five sole source COVID-19 testing contracts awarded by ASA in April 2020, totaling $1.8 billion.  As of October 2021, over $1.2 billion had been paid to the contractors., We reviewed: (1) ASA's justification and awarding process for the contracts; (2) signed contracts, contract modifications, statements of work, and negotiated payment rates for COVID-19 tests; and (3) a judgmental sample of 18 invoices totaling $217 million from the contracts., ASA awarded and managed five sole source COVID-19 testing contracts, totaling $1.8 billion, in accordance with Federal regulations and contract requirements.  Specifically, ASA complied with sole source justification requirements when awarding the contracts and set reasonable payment rates for COVID-19 tests in accordance with Federal regulations.  ASA appropriately managed the contracts by establishing and maintaining ongoing communications with contractors, by verifying that lab result numbers matched the number of tests administered, and by reviewing invoices to ensure payment rates were in accordance with the contract terms and conditions., This report contains no recommendations. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/dept.asp"">General Departmental</a>"

This is not a review of the HHS response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We conducted our first pulse survey of challenges that hospitals reported facing in response to COVID-19 during the early weeks of the pandemic (March 23-27, 2020).  This snapshot from 2021 provides HHS and other decisionmakers with updated information on hospital perspectives. , This report is based on a pulse survey conducted during February 22–26, 2021, with hospital administrators from 320 hospitals across 45 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  Interviews focused on three key questions:, In February 2021, hospitals reported that operating in ""survival mode"" for an extended period of time has created new and different problems than experienced earlier in the pandemic and exacerbated longstanding challenges in health care delivery, access, and health outcomes.  , <strong>Hospital-Reported Challenges.</strong>  Hospitals described difficulty balancing the complex and resource-intensive care needed for COVID-19 patients with efforts to resume routine hospital care.  They reported that staffing shortages have affected patient care, and that exhaustion and trauma have taken a toll on staff's mental health.  Administrators detailed challenges associated with vaccine distribution efforts and concerns about vaccine hesitancy among staff and members of their communities.  Hospitals also raised concerns that the pandemic has exacerbated existing disparities in access to care and health outcomes.  Additionally, many hospitals reported experiencing financial instability because of increased expenses associated with responding to a pandemic and lower revenues from decreased use of other hospital services.  Hospitals indicated that many of the challenges were more severe for rural hospitals., <strong>Addressing Hospital Challenges.</strong>  Hospitals reported a range of strategies to address their challenges and identified areas in which further government support could help as they continue responding to the pandemic.  Broadly, the areas of government support included enhancing knowledge and guidance on the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, including safe means to discharge patients with COVID-19; helping to fill gaps in hospital staffing, especially for nurses and certain specialists; continuing financial relief, especially to increase care to rural and underserved communities; and, encouraging widespread vaccinations to reduce the circulation of the virus., <strong>Looking Forward. </strong> Beyond the immediate needs in responding to COVID-19, the pulse survey documents hospitals' perspectives about longer-term opportunities for improvement to address challenges that existed before, and were exacerbated by, the pandemic.  These improvements include reducing disparities in access to health care and in health outcomes, building and maintaining a more robust health care workforce, and strengthening the resiliency of our health care system to respond to pandemics and other public health emergencies and disasters."

680,OEI-05-21-00170,Part D Plans Generally Include Drugs Commonly Used by Dual Eligibles: 2021 OEI-05-21-00170 06-28-2021,"This report fulfills for 2021 the annual reporting mandate from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  The ACA requires OIG to conduct a study of the extent to which formularies used by Medicare Part D plans include drugs commonly used by full benefit dual eligible individuals (i.e., individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits).  These individuals generally get drug coverage through Medicare Part D.  Pursuant to the ACA, OIG must annually issue a report with recommendations as appropriate.  This is the eleventh report that OIG has produced to meet this mandate. , For this report, we determined whether the 453 unique formularies used by the 5,128 Part D plans operating in 2021 cover the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles.  We also determined the extent to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools to those commonly used drugs.  To create the list of the 200 drugs most commonly used by dual eligibles, we used the 2018 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey-the most recent data available at the time of our study.  Of the top 200 drugs, 195 are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage, 2 are excluded from coverage, 1 is no longer offered as a prescription, and 1 is a medical supply item covered by Part D.  One additional drug is eligible for Part D coverage, but we did not include it in our analysis because we could not confidently project the use of this drug to the entire dual-eligible population., Overall, we found that the rate of Part D plan formularies' inclusion of the 195 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles is high, with some variation.  On average, Part D plan formularies include 97 percent of the 195 commonly used drugs.  In addition, 74 percent of the commonly used drugs are included by all Part D plan formularies.  These results are largely unchanged from OIG's findings in our mandated annual report from 2020, as well as from the findings in our reports from 2011 through 2019., We also found that the percentage of drugs to which plan formularies applied utilization management tools remained the same between 2020 and 2021.  On average, formularies applied utilization management tools to 29 percent of the unique drugs we reviewed in 2021, the same as in 2020., Inclusion rates for the 195 drugs commonly used by dual eligibles are largely unchanged from the inclusion rates listed in our previous reports.  Part D formularies include roughly the same high percentage of these commonly used drugs in 2021 as they did in 2020.  As mandated by the ACA, OIG will continue to monitor and produce annual reports on the extent to which Part D plan formularies cover drugs that dual eligibles commonly use.  OIG has no recommendations at this time."
681,OEI-02-21-00180,2020 Performance Data for the Senior Medicare Patrol Projects OEI-02-21-00180 06-28-2021,"This memorandum report presents performance data for the Senior Medicare Patrol
(SMP) projects, which receive grants from ACL to recruit and train retired professionals and other older adults and community members to recognize and report instances or patterns of health care fraud.  OIG has collected these performance data since 1997., We based our review on data reported by 54 SMP projects for 7 performance measures pertaining to recoveries, savings, and cost avoidance and 5 performance measures relating to
SMP activities.  For the first group of measures, we reviewed supporting documentation for the data.  For the second group, we reviewed the data for any discrepancies (e.g., if a project reported holding no events but reported a number of people who attended events)., The COVID-19 pandemic presented many challenges for the SMP projects that limited their activities.  As a result, the performance data for 2020 do not reflect a normal year of activities for the projects.  In 2020, the 54 SMP projects had a total of 5,720 active team members who conducted a total of 9,870 group outreach and education events, reaching an estimated 425,103 people.  In addition, the projects had 249,134 individual interactions with, or on behalf of, a Medicare beneficiary., For 2020, the SMP projects reported $16.8 million in expected Medicare recoveries.  Over half of these recoveries came from one project that uncovered a fraud scheme in which a provider paid beneficiaries to receive home health services that were never rendered.  The provider then submitted fraudulent claims to Medicare for millions of dollars while also receiving illegal kickback payments from the home health agencies.  The provider was sentenced and ordered to pay a total of $9.5 million in restitution and forfeitures.  In addition, cost avoidance totaled $53,768, while savings to beneficiaries and others totaled $33,554 for all SMP projects in 2020. , Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the SMP projects were not able to conduct in-person outreach events and face-to-face individual interactions as they have done in the past. As such, in 2020, the projects reported a decrease in the number of group outreach and education events, the number of people reached through these events, and the number of individual interactions, compared to 2019.  However, the projects reported significantly higher amounts of Medicare recoveries in 2020, an increase from $2.4 million to $16.8 million.  The majority of these recoveries were the result of investigations that were resolved in 2020 but had begun several years prior., In addition, the SMP program released two consumer fraud alerts on COVID-19 and genetic testing in 2020.  The alerts warn beneficiaries about potential fraud schemes involving COVID-19 vaccines and treatments and genetic testing.  The SMP program also provided OIG with 42 reports-referred to as Special Notifications-of new fraud trends based on ground level insights from the SMP projects.  These notifications focused on fraud schemes involving COVID-19 testing and vaccines, opioids, hospice services, drug prescribing, durable medical equipment, genetic testing, and other topics., We note that the projects may not be receiving full credit for recoveries, savings, and cost avoidance attributable to their work.  It is not always possible to track referrals to Medicare contractors or law enforcement from beneficiaries who have learned to detect fraud, waste, and abuse from the projects.  In addition, the projects are unable to track the potentially substantial savings derived from a sentinel effect, whereby Medicare beneficiaries' scrutiny of their bills reduces fraud and errors."
682,OEI-02-20-00401,Concerns Persist about Opioid Overdoses and Medicare Beneficiaries' Access to Treatment and Overdose-Reversal Drugs OEI-02-20-00401 08-10-2021,"See also: <a href=""https://hhs-oig-geo-hub-hhsoigbeta.hub.arcgis.com/apps/b9963de2160f44839550115c4c37fdea/explore"">Behavioral HealthMedication-Assisted Treatment Viewer</a>, The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects on the provision of health care have heightened concerns about opioid use and access to treatment.  The pandemic has put people with opioid use disorder at particular risk, as they are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 and are more likely to experience hospitalizations or death from the illness.  These increased risks posed by COVID-19 make urgent the need to monitor opioid use as well as access to treatment and to the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone., OIG has been tracking opioid use and access to treatment and naloxone in Part D for the past several years.   Before 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic, there were consistent decreases in opioid use in Part D.  There was also growth in the use of medications to treat opioid use disorder—referred to as medication-assisted treatment (MAT) drugs—and naloxone.  This data brief provides important information on opioid use, MAT drugs, and naloxone in Medicare Part D in 2020.  It builds on a previously released OIG data snapshot about opioid use during the onset of the pandemic.  , Monitoring opioid use and access to MAT drugs and naloxone has always been critical to fighting the opioid crisis in this country.  The COVID-19 pandemic has made these efforts even more pressing.  A May 2020 OIG data brief recommended that CMS educate Part D beneficiaries and providers about access to MAT drugs and naloxone.  We continue to encourage CMS to take these steps.  It is also critical for CMS to closely monitor the number of beneficiaries receiving MAT drugs and naloxone and take action, if needed.  OIG is also committed to continuing our work on opioid use and access to treatment."

684,OEI-03-21-00130,Medicare Part B Drug Payments: Impact of Price Substitutions Based on 2019 Average Sales Prices OEI-03-21-00130 06-11-2021,"When Congress established average sales prices (ASPs) as the basis for Medicare Part B drug reimbursement, it also provided a mechanism for monitoring market prices and limiting potentially excessive payment amounts.  Generally, Part B-covered drugs are those that are injected or infused in physicians' offices or hospital outpatient settings.  The Social Security Act (the Act) mandates that OIG compare ASPs with average manufacturer prices (AMPs).  If OIG finds that the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by a certain percentage (currently 5 percent), the Act directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to substitute the ASP based payment amount with a lower calculated rate.  Through regulation, CMS outlined that it would make this substitution only if the ASP for a drug exceeds the AMP by 5 percent in the two previous quarters or three of the previous four quarters. , Over the past decade, OIG has produced annual reports aggregating the results of our mandated quarterly ASP to-AMP comparisons.  This latest annual report quantifies the savings to Medicare and its beneficiaries that are a direct result of CMS's price substitution policy based on 2019 average sales prices.  This report also provides support for a previous OIG recommendation for achieving additional savings., To determine the effects of the price substitution policy, we determined the difference between ASP-based payment and AMP-based payment for each drug with a price substitution.  We then applied this difference to the Medicare utilization for each of these drugs.  To account for a three quarter lag between the reporting of pricing data and applying price substitutions, we used drug utilization data for the fourth quarter of 2019 through the third quarter of 2020 to calculate the savings based on 2019 ASP data.  , This data snapshot does not contain any recommendations.  However, OIG has previously recommended that CMS expand the price-substitution criteria.  CMS did not concur with expanding the price-substitution policy and expressed concern that expanding price-substitution criteria may impede physician and beneficiary access to drugs.  OIG agrees that access to prescription drugs should always be considered when contemplating pricing policies, and OIG supports current safeguards to prevent substitutions for drugs that the Food and Drug Administration has identified as being in short supply.  However, OIG continues to believe that CMS can achieve a better balance between safeguarding access to drugs and ensuring that Medicare and its beneficiaries do not overpay for drugs. "
685,OEI-09-21-00220,Toolkit: Insights from OIG's Work on the Office of Refugee Resettlement's Efforts To Care for Unaccompanied Children,"Unaccompanied children are children under the age of 18 who have no lawful immigration status in the United States and who have no parent or legal guardian in this country available to assume physical custody and provide care for them.  Most unaccompanied children come into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) because they are apprehended by border patrol officers with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  DHS must refer unaccompanied children to HHS within 72 hours unless there are exceptional circumstances.  
The Unaccompanied Children Program, a program office within ACF's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), funds a network of facilities that provide care to unaccompanied children, generally until suitable sponsors in the United States can assume custody., The toolkit compiles insights from OIG's oversight of the Unaccompanied Children Program.  We provide this information to assist ORR in responding to the current surge of unaccompanied children.  By mid-May 2021, the number of unaccompanied children referred to HHS in fiscal year 2021 had already exceeded referrals from 6 of the last 9 fiscal years., In order to respond to the 2021 surge, HHS has added capacity at State-licensed facilities and has opened new influx care facilities and emergency intake sites-two types of facilities that are not required to be State-licensed.  This toolkit outlines consequential actions that HHS program officials and facility administrators can take to ensure the health and safety of children in care, especially children at these new facilities.  This toolkit contains information that may be relevant for other policymakers as well., The insights provided in this toolkit are largely drawn from audits and evaluations conducted since 2008, including reports that were issued following site visits at 45 facilities during the 2018 surge of children entering the Unaccompanied Children Program.  The insights focus on three priority areas: (1) ensuring that HHS is prepared to take unaccompanied children into custody as they are transferred from immigration officials; (2) protecting children from harm; and (3) addressing children's medical and mental health.  This toolkit contains no new recommendations., Given the increase in the number of children in HHS custody, immediate actions that ORR can take to ensure children's health and safety include:"

687,A-09-21-03002,Medicare Improperly Paid Physicians for Spinal Facet-Joint Denervation Sessions A-09-21-03002 12-03-2021,"To address inappropriate billing for and overuse of spinal facet-joint denervation for pain management, the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) developed two limitations of coverage.  One coverage limitation, in place in 11 of the 12 MAC jurisdictions, allowed reimbursement during a 12-month period for a maximum of 2 denervation sessions per beneficiary related to the lumbar and cervical/thoracic regions of the spine.  The other coverage limitation allowed reimbursement for a maximum of 4 or 10 facet joints per denervation session, depending on the MAC jurisdiction.  A prior OIG audit found that MACs that limited coverage to five facet-joint injection sessions related to the lumbar and cervical/thoracic spines during a 12 month period had improperly paid physicians., Our objective was to determine whether Medicare paid physicians for selected facet-joint denervation sessions in accordance with Medicare requirements., For dates of service from January 2019 through August 2020 (audit period), our audit covered denervation sessions: (1) for beneficiaries who received more than 2 sessions for at least 1 covered spinal region (i.e., the lumbar or cervical/thoracic spines) during a 12-month period (totaling $16.8 million) and (2) that included denervation of more than 4 or 10 facet joints (totaling $10.9 million)., Medicare did not pay physicians for selected facet-joint denervation sessions in accordance with Medicare requirements.  Specifically, for our audit period, the MACs for the 11 jurisdictions with a coverage limitation of 2 facet-joint denervation sessions per beneficiary for each covered spinal region during a 12-month period made improper payments of $7.2 million.  In addition, the MACs for the 9 jurisdictions with a coverage limitation of 4 facet joints per denervation session and the MACs for the remaining 3 jurisdictions with a coverage limitation of 10 facet joints per denervation session made improper payments of $2.3 million.  In total, Medicare improperly paid physicians $9.5 million.  These improper payments occurred because the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services' (CMS's) oversight was not adequate to prevent or detect improper payments for selected facet-joint denervation sessions., We recommend that CMS: (1) direct the MACs to recover $9.5 million in improper payments made to physicians for selected facet-joint denervation sessions; (2) instruct the MACs to, based upon the results of this audit, notify appropriate physicians (i.e., those for whom CMS determines this audit constitutes credible information of potential overpayments) so that the physicians can exercise reasonable diligence to identify, report, and return any overpayments in accordance with the 60-day rule and identify any of those returned overpayments as having been made in accordance with this recommendation; and (3) assess the effectiveness of oversight mechanisms specific to preventing or detecting improper payments to physicians for facet-joint denervation sessions, and modify the oversight mechanisms based on that assessment.  We also made two procedural recommendations to CMS (detailed in the report) to direct the MACs to review claims for denervation sessions after our audit period to recover any improper payments., CMS concurred with our recommendations and described actions that it planned to take to address our recommendations, such as directing the MACs to recover overpayments and assessing the effectiveness of its oversight mechanisms., Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/cms.asp"">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>"

However, data on the number of nursing home residents who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or likely COVID-19 have not been readily available, particularly for early in the pandemic.  Nursing homes are not required to report cases and deaths that occurred before May 8, 2020. , This data snapshot provides objective, standardized data based on Medicare claims for all Medicare beneficiaries in nursing homes throughout the country.  This data snapshot is the first in a three-part series.  Subsequent work will address the characteristics of the hardest hit nursing homes and strategies used by nursing homes to confront the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic., The toll that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on Medicare beneficiaries in nursing homes demonstrates the need for increased action to mitigate the effects of the ongoing pandemic and to avert such tragedies from occurring in the future.  OIG is committed to understanding and helping to protect nursing home residents from the impacts of COVID-19.  We recognize that CMS is also committed to protecting nursing home residents.  Additional data analysis, particularly on Medicare claims data, may help CMS in its efforts.  Medicare claims data include demographic information about each beneficiary as well as information about the beneficiary's conditions and care needs.  These data are important to understanding the effects of the pandemic and, moving forward, could play an integral part in understanding health disparities within the nursing home population and preparing for and dealing with future public health crises.

CMS calculated new rates that took effect in 2018.  As part of PAMA, Congress also mandated that OIG publicly release an annual analysis of the top 25 tests based on Medicare Part B spending and conduct analyses that OIG determines appropriate.  This data brief provides an analysis of Medicare payments for lab tests in 2020., We analyzed claims data for lab tests performed in 2020 that CMS paid for under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS).  These tests are covered under Medicare Part B and do not include COVID-19 tests provided by community testing programs or tests that Medicare paid for under other payment systems, such as the payment system for critical access hospitals or the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System.  We identified the top 25 lab tests based on Medicare spending for tests performed in 2020.  We also identified key statistics and emerging trends, including Medicare spending by procedure code and test category. , Medicare Part B spending on lab tests in 2020 was affected by significant new spending on COVID-19 tests, a type of test that did not exist before the pandemic.  Overall spending increased from $7.7 billion in 2019 to $8.0 billion in 2020.  This increase in spending was driven by $1.5 billion in new spending on COVID-19 tests, including $1.0 billion on a rapid COVID-19 test, which was the number 1 test by spending., Aside from COVID-19 tests, spending for all other tests, as a group, decreased by about 
$1.2 billion in 2020.  The decline in spending was driven by a sharp decline in non-COVID-19 tests during the early months of the pandemic, as well as further reductions in payment rates for some of these tests, as required by PAMA. , The decline in volume for non-COVID-19 tests raises questions about the potential impact on beneficiary health and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have an impact on Medicare Part B spending on lab tests beyond 2020.  We will continue to monitor annual payments for lab tests, including COVID-19 tests."

701,OEI-02-20-00521,Most Medicare beneficiaries received telehealth services only from providers with whom they had an established relationship 10-18-2021 OEI-02-20-00521,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, both Congress and the Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) expanded access to a wide range of medical services that can be delivered via telehealth (i.e., telehealth services).  This expansion enhanced the ability of health care providers to offer care to Medicare beneficiaries remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Prior to the pandemic, beneficiaries were only able to receive certain telehealth services from providers with whom they had an established relationship.  However, HHS announced that it will use its discretion to not enforce requirements for established relationships during the pandemic., While the expansion of telehealth has been essential to maintaining beneficiaries' access to care, there have been concerns about the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse associated with expanded telehealth services.  This data snapshot provides information to policymakers and other stakeholders about the relationship between beneficiaries and providers for telehealth services.  These data are critical to informing decisions about how to structure telehealth services in Medicare on a more permanent basis.  Understanding how likely beneficiaries are to receive telehealth services from a provider with whom they have had an established relationship, and the average timeframe between an in-person visit and a telehealth service, can help inform decisions on how frequently in-person care may need to be paired with telehealth services.  This snapshot is part of a series of reports on telehealth; the other reports focus on telehealth utilization and program integrity., We reviewed Medicare claims data for telehealth services provided from March through December 2020.  We determined the proportion of beneficiaries who received telehealth services only from providers with whom they had an established relationship and looked for any differences among the 10 most common types of telehealth services and between beneficiaries enrolled in traditional Medicare and those enrolled in Medicare Advantage.  For beneficiaries who had an established relationship with their providers, we determined the average amount of time between their first telehealth service and their most recent in-person visit for each of their providers. , Most beneficiaries received telehealth services from providers with whom they had an established relationship.  Notably, 84 percent of beneficiaries received telehealth services only from providers with whom they had an established relationship.  Those enrolled in traditional Medicare were more likely to receive services from providers with whom they had an established relationship, compared to beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage.  This pattern persisted among virtually all of the most common telehealth services.  Beneficiaries tended to see their providers in person about 4 months prior to their first telehealth service, on average., Data on how likely beneficiaries are to receive telehealth services from a provider with whom they have had an established relationship can be used to inform decisions about how to best use telehealth in Medicare and should be taken into account as policymakers continue to examine telehealth utilization and concerns about telehealth being vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.  This includes decisions about which services to allow to be delivered via telehealth on a more permanent basis and to what extent Medicare should require that beneficiaries have a relationship with their providers prior to receiving certain telehealth services."

More than 13 million beneficiaries are served by long-term-care facilities each year, including the elderly, individuals in hospice care, and individuals with intellectual disabilities., The National Background Check Program (Program), enacted by legislation in 2010, provides grants to States and territories (States) to assist them in developing and improving systems to conduct Federal and State background checks of prospective long-term-care employees.  Included in this legislation is a mandate that OIG produce an evaluation of the Program within 180 days of Program completion.  This report-the fifth in a series to supplement the mandated evaluation-reviews Idaho and Mississippi, the last two States that are participating in the Program.  (Twenty-seven States have completed their participation in the Program.)  The interim review allows for CMS to assist the States in fully implementing Program requirements during participation.  In future work, we will assess the Program overall., We reviewed grant monitoring documents and financial reports to determine the extent to which Idaho and Mississippi are working towards meeting Program requirements.  Specifically, we evaluated the States' ability to obtain legislative authority and to coordinate between State-level agencies.  Additionally, we evaluated States' monitoring documents., OIG found that Idaho and Mississippi lacked State legislative authority to implement some Program requirements.  Further, both States encountered challenges with coordination between State-level departments responsible for seeking legislative authority.  , OIG found additional concerns with Mississippi.  First, Mississippi was unable to submit required data to CMS to calculate determinations of ineligibility.  This is despite the fact that Mississippi conducted background checks during the first years of Program participation.  Additionally, Mississippi and Idaho did not consistently report Federal and State funds on required quarterly financial reports; this made it difficult for CMS to determine the ongoing cost of Program implementation., These report findings are consistent with findings in previous OIG reports about challenges that States experienced during Program participation.  Therefore, we recommend that CMS continue to implement OIG's prior recommendations for it to take appropriate actions to (1) encourage States to obtain the necessary legislative authority from the State to fully implement Program requirements, and (2) require participating States to consistently submit data that allow CMS and each State to calculate determinations of ineligibility.  In addition, with this report, we recommend that CMS ensure that participating States submit accurate quarterly reports.  CMS concurred with this recommendation."

The State agency claims the costs for the courts that are related to child support services. Based on a prior Office of Child Support Enforcement audit and current issues we found during our preliminary review, we selected court costs specific to the cooperative agreement for review. , Our objective was to determine whether the State agency claimed administrative court costs for the Title IV-D Child Support Enforcement Program (the CSE program) that were allowable and in accordance with Federal and State requirements. , We reviewed direct staff salaries and building-space costs, which represents a high percentage of the total eligible Title IV-D costs included in the establishment of the county rates. We performed analysis on the 2016 through 2017 motions, petitions, and requests (MPRs) invoiced by the court and reimbursed by the State agency during our audit period., The State agency claimed IV-D administrative costs that were not allowable or supported during Federal fiscal years 2016 and 2017. Specifically, we found the State agency claimed (1) $180,288 ($118,990 Federal share) in unallowable costs for 1,000 duplicate MPRs out of 17,919, which had been paid previously; (2) $48,891 ($32,268 Federal share) in unallowable costs due to the incorrect IV-D county rate paid of $186.84 instead of $144.62 to one county for all 1,158 MPRs; and (3) $1.37 million ($907,051 Federal share) in unsupported costs due to the salary allocation of 156 employees included in individual county rates. , The State agency claimed these unallowable and unsupported costs because it did not (1) ensure the court MPR processing system had edits and controls in place to prevent or detect duplicate MPRs from being processed (2) have any policies and procedures in place for the review and approval of invoices and supporting documentation prior to the payment to the court administrator's office, and (3) have any policies and procedures in place for allocating salaries to the individual family courts which could have ensured allocations are supported and accurately reflect the relative benefits received. As a result, the State agency included $229,179 ($151,258 Federal share) in unallowable expenditures and $1.37 million ($907,051 Federal share) in unsupported costs on the OCSE-396 quarterly reports during our audit period. , We recommend that the Vermont Office of Child Support (1) refund $229,179 ($151,258 Federal share) in unallowable expenditures, and (2) work with ACF to determine what portion of the $1.37 million ($907,051 Federal share) for unsupported salaries allocated represents Title IV-D eligible costs or refund the entire amount. We also make procedural recommendations to improve the State agency's CSE program operations. , In written comments on our draft report, the State agency concurred with our recommendations. , Filed under: <a href=""/reports-and-publications/oas/acf.asp"">Administration for Children and Families</a>"

### Introduction

OIG's mission is to provide objective oversight to promote the economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and integrity of HHS programs, as well as the health and welfare of the people they serve.

• Safeguarding the Medicare Trust Funds  
• Strengthening Medicaid protections against fraud, waste, and abuse  
• Protecting beneficiaries from prescription drug abuse, including opioids  
• Ensuring health and safety for children served by HHS programs  
• Combatting cybersecurity threats within HHS and healthcare  
• Promoting patient safety and accuracy of payments in home and community settings
• Leveraging technology as it intersects with HHS programs  
• Ensuring HHS managed care and new healthcare models produce value  
• Identifying opportunities to lower prescription drug spending for patients and programs 

### Questions
1. Are plans (work plans) and findings (reports) similar in terms of topics identified and scope? 
2. How closely do the topics of work identified in the models connect to the priorities outlined by HHS OIG?
3. Are there any topics that appear to be underrepresented from the reports and data?
